# create-phase-plan

Create a high-level phase implementation plan from the folder-mcp roadmap with comprehensive context engineering.

## Context Engineering Principles

This command follows context engineering best practices:
- **Minimize Cognitive Load**: Present information in logical, digestible sections
- **Maximize Relevance**: Include ALL context needed to understand and implement the phase
- **Enable Deep Understanding**: Connect phase work to overall project goals and architecture
- **Reduce Back-and-Forth**: Anticipate what information will be needed during implementation

## Usage

```
/create-phase-plan <phase-number>
```

## EXACT Implementation Instructions

When this command is executed, you MUST:

1. **FIRST: Validate Previous Phase Complete (if creating Phase N+1)**:
   - Check `docs/development-plan/roadmap/currently-implementing/` for Phase N documents
   - If Phase N documents exist, verify ALL tasks are ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
     - Read each `Phase-N-Task-X-*.md` file
     - Check "Progress Tracking" ‚Üí "Assignment Status" for ‚úÖ COMPLETED markers
     - Check "Time Tracking" table for "Complete" status
   - **IF INCOMPLETE**: STOP with validation error message (see template below)
   - **IF COMPLETE**: Archive Phase N documents to `completed/phase-N/`

2. **Archive Previous Phase (if validated complete)**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/development-plan/roadmap/completed/phase-N
   mv docs/development-plan/roadmap/currently-implementing/Phase-N-*.md \
      docs/development-plan/roadmap/completed/phase-N/
   ```

3. **Read the ENTIRE roadmap file for context**:
   - File: `docs/development-plan/roadmap/folder-mcp-roadmap-1.1.md`
   - First scan for: Project Goal, Architecture sections, Component Definitions, Success Metrics
   - Then find the section starting with `## Phase <number>:`
   - Extract ALL content until the next `## Phase` section
   - Look back for any sections referenced by the phase

4. **Extract these EXACT elements**:
   - Phase number and name from the heading
   - All user stories from "### **User Stories**" section
   - Success criteria from "### **Success Criteria**" section
   - All tasks from "### Task X:" sections (scan for all tasks in the phase)
   - Phase completion review requirements
   - Any configuration examples or architecture details mentioned in tasks
   - Related sections from earlier in roadmap that provide context (e.g., Configuration Architecture, Component Definitions)

5. **Count the tasks correctly**:
   - Search for all "### Task [number]:" patterns within the phase
   - The task count determines the progress tracking

6. **Generate the output file**:
   - Location: `docs/development-plan/roadmap/currently-implementing/Phase-{number}-{name-kebab-case}-plan.md`
   - Use the EXACT template format below
   - Fill in ALL extracted information

### Validation Error Template

If previous phase is incomplete, output this format:

```markdown
‚ùå **Cannot create Phase [N+1] - Phase [N] is incomplete**

### Issues Found:
- [ ] **Phase-[N]-Task-[X]**: [List incomplete assignments]
- [ ] **Phase-[N]-Task-[Y]**: Time tracking shows "In Progress"
- [ ] **Phase-[N]-Task-[Z]**: Missing ‚úÖ COMPLETED markers

### Required Actions:
1. Complete all remaining assignments in Phase [N]
2. Mark all assignments with ‚úÖ COMPLETED in task documents
3. Update time tracking tables to show "Complete" status
4. Run `/next-please` to verify phase completion
5. Then retry: `/create-phase-plan [N+1]`

**Phase [N] must be 100% complete before starting Phase [N+1]**
```

## Required Output Format

## üìù **Phase Completion Checklist**

Before marking this phase complete:
- [ ] All tasks completed and validated
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality  
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests added for new features
- [ ] Phase review conducted
- [ ] Next phase dependencies satisfied

[INCLUDE PHASE COMPLETION REVIEW REQUIREMENTS FROM ROADMAP IF SPECIFIED]

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

After completing this phase:
1. Run `/create-phase-plan [NEXT PHASE NUMBER]` for Phase [X+1]: [NEXT PHASE NAME]
2. Conduct phase retrospective
3. Update roadmap with actual timings

---

**To implement individual tasks, use:**
```
/create-task-plan [PHASE] 1  # Start with first task
```
```

## CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES

1. **Task Counting**: You MUST find ALL "### Task X:" sections in the phase to get accurate count
2. **Exact Names**: Use EXACT task names from roadmap, not summaries
3. **Phase Boundaries**: Stop extracting when you hit the next "## Phase" section
4. **User Stories**: Copy them VERBATIM, including bullet formatting
5. **Success Criteria**: Include ALL criteria from the phase section
6. **Implementation Details**: Include ALL code examples, YAML configs, and detailed explanations from each task
7. **Broader Context**: Look for related sections in the roadmap that provide context:
   - For Phase 6: Include Configuration Architecture section
   - For Phase 7: Include endpoint details and search modes
   - For Phase 8: Include transport decisions and SSE details
   - Component Definitions when new components are introduced
   - System Architecture when it's being modified

## Example Extraction for Phase 6

From roadmap you should find:
- Phase Name: "Configuration Foundation & CLI/TUI Parity"
- Task Count: 6 (not 11)
- Tasks:
  1. Configuration System Foundation
  2. Basic Daemon Architecture  
  3. Extend MCP Server for Multiple Folders
  4. Configuration-Aware CLI Commands
  5. Configuration-Driven TUI
  6. CLI/TUI Parity Validation

## Validation

After generating, verify:
- [ ] Task count matches actual tasks in roadmap phase
- [ ] All task names are exact matches
- [ ] User stories are complete
- [ ] Success criteria are included
- [ ] File is created in correct location
