Include these sections in the file:\n1. A description of the step.\n\n2. A checklist of all tasks in **linear execution order**.  \n   - For each task:\n     - A short **description**.\n     - A **clear success criterion**.\n   - Format the tasks using markdown checkboxes: `- [ ]`.\n\n3. The last task of the plan should be \"Run a real world example with Claude Desktop.\"  \n   - The procedure for testing Claude Desktop is described in `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_TEST_ROUTINE.md`.  \n   - Ask the Agent to supply a prompt to test MCP server functionality and this step's implementation.  \n   - When you create this last task, also insert a link to the `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_TEST_ROUTINE.md` file.\n\n4. Add a section for **Agent Instructions** at the end of the file with the following content:  \n   - This tool is in pre-production, so do **not** preserve any legacy code.  \n   - Test folder paths:\n     - Full test folder: `C:\\ThinkingHomes\\test-folder`\n     - Simple test folder: `C:\\ThinkingHomes\\test-simple`\n   - On Windows, use PowerShell command chaining with `;` instead of `&&`.\n   - Regularly update the file and mark completed steps: `- [x]`.\n   - Keep the plan file as the **single source of truth** for progress tracking.\n```\n\n\n## 2. 🛠️ STEP MID EXECUTION INTERVENTION PROMPTS\nUse **during** implementation.\n\n### 2.1 🧾 Figure out where we left off in our tasklist.\n```\n**Figure out where we left off in our tasklist**:\n   - Identify the next Step from `UPCOMING_TASKS.md`. from now on, we will refer to this step as `STEP_[current_step_number]`. eg `STEP_31`.\n   - Read the STEP_[current_step_number]_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file.\n   - check if the progress is up to date. fix it if not.\n   - let me know where we left off in the task list.\n```\n\n\n## 3. 📚 CONCLUDING A STEP\nUse **once cleanup is done**, before starting the next step.\n### DOCUMENTATION & ROADMAP UPDATE\n#### 3.1 📘 Update Roadmap Docs Prompt\n```\n**[Step 31] is Complete, Update UPCOMING_TASKS.md and COMPLETED_TASKS.md in roadmap documents folder**:\n   - Mark the step as \"✅ COMPLETED\"\n   - Update \"current\" status to the next step\n   - review the rest of our upcoming tasks and suggest if any decision we took to complete the current step has affected any of the upcoming tasks.\n   - move this step, along with other completed steps, to the \"COMPLETED_TASKS.md\" file.\n```\n#### 3.2 📘 Running manual tests\n```\n**Lets verify that the MCP server is working correctly**:\n   - Make sure there are no typescript compilation errors.\n   - Run npm test to verify that ALL tests pass.\n   - Run the `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_TEST_ROUTINE.md` routine to verify that the MCP server is working correctly.\n\n```\n#### 3.3 📘GIT & GITHUB OPERATIONS\n##### 3.3.1 ✅ Close Current Step Issue Prompt\n```\n**Close the current step issue in GitHub**:\n   - Using gh tool Find the GitHub issue for the step\n   - Update step body to the content of `STEP_X_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (make sure all the tasks are marked as completed, otherwise warn me and stop!)\n   - Close the issue with completion comment\n```\n##### 3.3.2 🆕 Create Next Step Issue Prompt\n```\n**Create a new GitHub issue for the next step in the roadmap.**:\n1.
