8. **Phase 8 - Release Preparation** (Due: TBD)

## GitHub Labels to Create

- `enhancement` (blue)
- `foundation` (gray) 
- `cli` (green)
- `filesystem` (yellow)
- `parsing` (orange)
- `caching` (purple)
- `processing` (pink)
- `embeddings` (red)
- `search` (light blue)
- `mcp` (dark blue)

## Issue Creation Workflow

For each of the 30 issues in `GITHUB_ISSUES.md`:

1. **Create new issue**
2. **Copy title** (e.g., "Initialize TypeScript Project")
3. **Copy description and success criteria**
4. **Add appropriate labels** 
5. **Set milestone**
6. **For issues 1-13**: Immediately close with comment "‚úÖ COMPLETED - Already implemented in current codebase"
7. **For issues 14-30**: Leave open as TODO

## Automated Alternative

If you have GitHub CLI installed (`gh`), you can use this script:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first: https://cli.github.com/
# Then run from project directory:

gh issue create --title "Smart Text Chunking" --body "$(cat issue-14.md)" --label "enhancement,processing" --milestone "Phase 3 - Processing"
# Repeat for each issue...
```

## Project Status After Setup

After creating all issues:
- ‚úÖ **13 Closed Issues** (Completed tasks)
- üîÑ **17 Open Issues** (TODO tasks)  
- üìä **8 Milestones** (Development phases)
- üè∑Ô∏è **18 Labels** (Task categorization)

This provides a complete GitHub project management setup for tracking the evolution from the current basic MCP server to the full universal folder-to-MCP tool vision.

## Benefits
