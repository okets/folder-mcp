# ContainerListItem Redesign - Manual Test Sequence

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive manual testing sequence for the redesigned ContainerListItem with the new ViewportSystem architecture.

## Prerequisites
```bash
npm run build  # Ensure latest code is compiled
npm run tui    # Launch the TUI interface
```

## Test Environment Setup

The redesigned ContainerListItem should be visible in the TUI interface wherever container components are used (such as the FirstRunWizard or configuration screens).

## Test Sequence

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality Tests

#### Test 1.1: Collapsed State Display

**Steps**:
1. Launch `npm run tui`
2. Navigate to any ContainerListItem in collapsed state
3. Observe the display

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Icon and label displayed correctly
- ✅ Text truncation works if label is too long
- ✅ Proper color coding (active vs inactive)
- ✅ No scroll indicators visible

**Pass Criteria**: Container shows as single line with proper formatting

---

#### Test 1.2: Basic Expansion/Collapse
**Goal**: Verify container can be expanded and collapsed

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to a ContainerListItem
2. Press `Enter` to expand
3. Press `Escape` to collapse
4. Repeat 3-4 times rapidly

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Container expands to show child items
- ✅ Header line shows with container icon/label
- ✅ Child items displayed with `│ ` prefix
- ✅ Confirmation line shows at bottom
- ✅ Smooth transitions, no flickering
- ✅ Collapse returns to single line

**Pass Criteria**: Reliable expand/collapse with clean visual transitions

---

#### Test 1.3: Basic Navigation
**Goal**: Verify navigation within expanded container

**Steps**:
1. Expand a container with multiple child items
2. Use `↑` and `↓` arrows to navigate
3. Observe active item highlighting
4. Navigate to confirmation line and back

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Arrow keys move between child items
- ✅ Active item clearly highlighted
- ✅ Navigation skips non-navigable items
- ✅ Down arrow eventually reaches confirmation
- ✅ Up arrow from confirmation returns to last child

5. Press `↓` (should go to confirmation)
6. Press `↑` from confirmation (should go to last item)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Up from first item goes to confirmation (circular)

   - Navigate to last item, press `↓` → should go to confirmation
   - From confirmation, press `↑` → should go to last item
3. Test left/right arrows:
   - Select any item, press `→` → should open sub-item (if applicable)
   - Press `←` → should close container
4. Test from various positions to ensure consistency

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ `↑` from first item → confirmation (circular)
- ✅ `↓` from last item → confirmation (circular)  
- ✅ `↑` from confirmation → last navigable item
- ✅ `↓` from confirmation → first navigable item
- ✅ `→` opens sub-items when available
- ✅ `←` always closes container

#### Test 3.2: Nested Container Behavior
**Goal**: Test containers with interactive child items

**Steps**:
1. Find a container with SelectionListItem or similar interactive children
