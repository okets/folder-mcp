# Phase 1 Completion Documentation

## Overview
Phase 1 of the folder-mcp project has been successfully completed. This phase focused on establishing the foundational architecture, implementing the core MCP server functionality, and ensuring Claude Desktop integration.

## Completed Milestones

### Architecture Foundation
- Clean layered architecture with proper boundaries
- Dependency injection system
- Clear separation of concerns
- Module structure established

### MCP Server Implementation
- Created clean MCP server implementation following architecture guidelines
- Implemented proper JSON-RPC protocol handling
- Implemented hello_world tool with parameter support
- Fixed critical Claude Desktop integration issues

### Error Handling
- Implemented consistent error handling throughout the application
- Proper logging with separation between stdout (protocol) and stderr (logs)
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Documentation
- Added CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md with detailed configuration and troubleshooting
- Updated README.md with correct usage information
- Created detailed FIX_MCP_SERVER.md with step-by-step rebuild plan

## Lessons Learned
1. MCP protocol requires strict adherence to JSON-RPC format on stdout
2. All logging must be redirected to stderr only
3. Claude Desktop integration has specific error handling requirements
4. Proper architecture boundaries are essential for maintainability

## Next Steps
1. Implement file operation tools (Phase 4)
2. Integrate with existing application layer services (Phase 5)
3. Add comprehensive testing (Phase 6)
4. Finalize documentation and CI/CD integration
