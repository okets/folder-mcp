## üßπ **Phase 1: Clean Environment Setup**
*Ensure a fresh testing environment to avoid false results*

### Step 1: Verify VSCode Version
**What**: Check VSCode supports MCP features  
**Why**: VSCode 1.101+ required for MCP integration

```powershell
# Run this command and verify output shows 1.101.0 or higher
code --version
```

**Expected Output**: 
```
1.101.0 (or higher)
[commit hash]
[platform info]
```

**‚ùå If version is older**: Update VSCode before proceeding  
**‚úÖ Success**: Version 1.101.0+ confirmed

---

### Step 2: Clean VSCode MCP State
**What**: Remove any cached MCP server data  
**Why**: Prevent old configurations from interfering

```powershell
# Clear MCP server cache (run even if files don't exist)
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\Code\User\globalStorage\ms-vscode.vscode-copilot\mcpServers.json" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Clear any workspace-specific MCP data
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\Code\User\workspaceStorage\*\ms-vscode.vscode-copilot\*" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**Expected**: Commands complete without errors (files may not exist, that's OK)  
**‚úÖ Success**: Commands completed

---

### Step 3: Kill Any Running MCP Servers
**What**: Stop any folder-mcp processes  
**Why**: Ensure clean server startup

```powershell
# Find and kill any running MCP servers
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq "node" -and $_.CommandLine -like "*mcp-server*"} | Stop-Process -Force

# Alternative if above doesn't work
taskkill /f /im node.exe /fi "WINDOWTITLE eq mcp*" 2>$null
```

**Expected**: Either no processes found, or processes killed successfully  
**‚úÖ Success**: No MCP server processes running

---

### Step 4: Clean Test Workspace
**What**: Remove any cached folder-mcp data  
**Why**: Ensure fresh indexing and testing

```powershell
# Remove folder-mcp cache from test directory
Remove-Item "C:\ThinkingHomes\test-folder\.folder-mcp" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Verify test folder exists, create if needed
if (!(Test-Path "C:\ThinkingHomes\test-folder")) {
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\ThinkingHomes\test-folder"
    Write-Host "Created test folder"
}
```

**Expected**: Test folder exists and is clean  
**‚úÖ Success**: Test folder ready

---

### Step 5: Verify Project Build
**What**: Ensure folder-mcp builds without errors  
**Why**: TypeScript errors will prevent MCP server from working

```powershell
cd C:\ThinkingHomes\folder-mcp
npm run build
```

**Expected Output**: Build completes with "Build completed successfully" or similar  
**‚ùå If build fails**: Fix TypeScript errors before proceeding  
**‚úÖ Success**: Build completed without errors

---

## üîß **Phase 2: VSCode Configuration**
*Configure VSCode to work with your MCP server*

### Step 6: Create MCP Server Configuration
**What**: Tell VSCode how to connect to folder-mcp  
**Why**: VSCode needs connection details to start the MCP server

**Action**: Create file `C:\ThinkingHomes\test-folder\.vscode\mcp.json`

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "folder-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\ThinkingHomes\\folder-mcp\\dist\\mcp-server.js"],
      "dev": {
        "watch": "C:\\ThinkingHomes\\folder-mcp\\dist/**/*.js",
        "debug": { "type": "node" }
      },
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development",
        "MCP_DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: 
- Create the `.vscode` folder first if it doesn't exist
- Use absolute paths (not relative paths)
- Double backslashes in Windows paths

**‚úÖ Success**: File created with correct content

---

### Step 7: Launch VSCode with Test Workspace
**What**: Open VSCode in the test directory  
**Why**: VSCode needs to be running in the test workspace to find MCP configuration

```powershell
# Open VSCode in test workspace
code C:\ThinkingHomes\test-folder

# Wait for VSCode to fully load (about 10 seconds)
Start-Sleep -Seconds 10
```

**What to Look For**:
1. VSCode opens with `test-folder` as the workspace
2. You can see `.vscode/mcp.json` in the Explorer panel
3. No immediate error notifications appear

**‚úÖ Success**: VSCode opened in test workspace

---

## üîç **Phase 3: Basic MCP Connection Test**
*Verify VSCode can find and connect to your MCP server*

### Step 8: Check MCP Server Discovery
**What**: Verify VSCode detects the folder-mcp server  
**Why**: This is the foundation - if VSCode can't see the server, nothing else will work

**Actions**:
1. In VSCode, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Command Palette)
2. Type `MCP: List Servers`
3. Press Enter

**Expected Results**:
- Command executes without error
- Shows a list with `folder-mcp` server
- Server status should be "Starting" or "Running"

**‚ùå Troubleshooting if server not found**:
1. Check `.vscode/mcp.json` file exists and has correct content
2. Verify file paths are absolute and correct
3. Restart VSCode completely
4. Check VSCode output panel for MCP errors

**‚úÖ Success**: folder-mcp server appears in server list

---

### Step 9: Verify MCP Server Connection
**What**: Confirm the server is actually running and responding  
**Why**: Server might appear in list but fail to start

**Actions**:
1. Open VSCode Output panel (`View > Output`)
2. Select "MCP" from the dropdown
3. Look for connection messages

**Expected Log Messages**:
```
[INFO] Starting MCP server: folder-mcp
[INFO] MCP server connected successfully
[INFO] Handshake completed
```

**‚ùå If you see errors**:
- Connection failed: Check server paths in mcp.json
- Permission denied: Run VSCode as administrator
- Module not found: Ensure `npm run build` completed successfully

**‚úÖ Success**: Server connected without errors

---

### Step 10: Test Basic Tool Discovery
**What**: Verify VSCode can see MCP tools  
**Why**: Tools are what make MCP useful - they must be discoverable

**Actions**:
1. Open VSCode Chat panel (`View > Chat` or `Ctrl+Alt+I`)
2. Click the "Agent" mode button (robot icon)
3. Click "Configure Tools" button
4. Look for folder-mcp tools in the list

**Expected Tools** (should see these 9+ tools):
- `get_status` - System status information
- `search_documents` - Search through documents  
- `search_chunks` - Search document chunks
- `list_folders` - List folders in workspace
- `list_documents` - List documents in folder
- `get_document_content` - Get document content
- `get_document_metadata` - Get document info
- `summarize_document` - Summarize documents
- `refresh_document` - Refresh document processing

**‚ùå If no tools appear**:
1. Wait 30 seconds and refresh
2. Check MCP output logs for tool registration errors
3. Verify MCP server is still running
4. Restart VSCode if needed

**‚úÖ Success**: All expected tools are visible and can be selected

---

## üéØ **Phase 4: Real-World Usage Test**
*Test how the MCP server performs with actual user tasks*

### Step 11: Create Test Content
**What**: Create realistic content for testing  
**Why**: We need actual documents to test search and analysis features

**Action**: Create file `C:\ThinkingHomes\test-folder\VSCODE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

```markdown
