####  ☁️ Cloudflare Tunnel plan prompt
Give me full implementation plan for implementing cloudflare Tunnel. with all required steps, including registering the domain mcp-folder.link (or folder-mcp.app, haven't decided yet) with the  service.
my goal is to have the user run my CLI app locally, have it process the data -> serve it using MCP server
the user should have a connection address with this format fdsl3442356lkl.folder-mcp.link
also, check what are the implications if the user shuts off his computer for the night.
will it still work after starting it again?
