# folder-mcp Features Overview

This document extracts and organizes all major features from the legacy roadmap, regardless of implementation order. Features are grouped as To Implement, Completed, and Irrelevant/No Longer Required.

## Features To Implement

- VSCode-native MCP integration and optimization
- Enhanced MCP server with:
  - Advanced prompts and tool descriptions (context-aware, usage examples, parameter validation, error handling, usage patterns)
  - Sophisticated pagination (cursor-based, configurable sizes, stateless tokens, deep pagination, performance optimization)
  - Advanced search (complex metadata filtering, AND/OR, date range, author/type, ranking, semantic similarity, performance)
  - Rich metadata system (author, timestamps, type, language detection, custom fields, indexing/search)
  - Batch operations (batch processing, streaming, progress tracking, cancellation, memory efficiency, rate limiting)
  - Enhanced summarization (multiple modes, batch, caching, templates, multi-language, quality scoring)
  - Table query enhancements (SQL-like queries, cross-doc analysis, joins, export, schema detection, performance)
  - Real-time status & monitoring (indexing progress, analytics dashboard, memory, error reporting, health checks, resource usage)
  - Advanced configuration management (hierarchical loading, env vars, validation, runtime updates, templates, migration)
  - Robust error handling & recovery (classification, user-friendly messages, retries, degradation, logging, recovery docs)
  - Comprehensive documentation (API docs, integration guides, troubleshooting, performance, best practices, usage examples)
  - Security enhancements (permissions, path traversal, input validation, resource limits, audit logging, config options)
  - Extensibility framework (plugin system, custom tool registration, hooks, plugin config, loading/validation, docs)
  - Multi-language support (Unicode, tokenization, multilingual embeddings, detection/tagging, localized errors, RTL)
  - Performance optimization (memory, CPU, disk I/O, caching, DB queries, concurrency)
  - Integration testing & validation (end-to-end, performance, integration, stress, error, user acceptance)
- CLI interface:
  - Parameter override system
  - Interactive configuration wizard
  - System detection & auto-configuration
  - Keyboard navigation interface
  - Full-screen TUI
  - Advanced help system
  - User interaction framework (progress bars, dialogs, validation, workflows, undo/redo, notifications)
  - CLI testing & validation
- Remote connections:
  - Remote access foundation (gRPC TCP, API key, TLS/mTLS, hybrid security, config)
  - HTTP gateway (REST/JSON, OpenAPI, CORS, validation)
  - Cloudflare tunnel integration (dynamic subdomains, zero-config, SSL, analytics)
  - Certificate management (Let's Encrypt, self-signed, provisioning, monitoring, validation)
  - Authentication & security (API key lifecycle, rate limiting, audit logging, access control, secure storage)
  - Alternative tunneling providers (ngrok, localtunnel, provider selection, fallback, health monitoring)
  - Remote configuration management (profiles, env vars, secure storage, validation, dynamic updates, templates)
  - Performance optimization for remote (connection pooling, compression, caching, load balancing, monitoring, bandwidth)
  - Monitoring & analytics (usage, performance, security, health, alerting, reporting)
  - Remote access testing & validation
- Internal CLI chat:
  - Chat configuration wizard (transport selection, provider, API key validation, Ollama detection, model recommendation)
  - Cloud provider integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, streaming, rate limiting, error handling)
  - Local LLM integration (Ollama, model management, auto-download, resource monitoring, recommendations, streaming)
  - Interactive chat interface (context-aware, retrieval, source attribution, streaming, chat commands, batch integration)
  - Advanced chat features (history, multi-turn, filtering, export, templates, shortcuts)
  - Chat session management (persistence, naming, search, sharing, privacy, analytics)
  - Chat testing & validation
- Release preparation:
  - Hugging Face Hub integration for model metadata
  - Production performance optimization & tuning
  - Comprehensive test suite integration
  - Documentation & API reference
  - Release preparation & distribution (containerization, CI/CD, npm, binaries, Docker, docs site, release management, community support)

---

## Completed Features

- Foundation through complete endpoints implementation
- Dual-protocol transport system (MCP + gRPC)
- All 13 gRPC endpoints with corresponding MCP tools
- Local Unix Domain Socket transport
- 277+ tests passing
- Claude Desktop successfully accessing and searching folders
- Phases 1-7: Foundation through Basic MCP Server

---

## Irrelevant / No Longer Required

- Any features or steps that were specific to the old MCP endpoint design and are not part of your new architecture (not explicitly listed here; add as identified)
- Any features now handled by VSCode-native capabilities or superseded by new platform features
