# Task 6.3: Extend MCP Server for Multiple Folders

**Phase**: 6 - Configuration Foundation & CLI/TUI Parity  
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS  
**Created**: 2025-07-06  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Approach**: Transform single-folder MCP server to configuration-driven multi-folder system while preserving all existing functionality

## üéØ **Task Objective**

Modify existing MCP server to handle multiple folders with per-folder configuration

## üîç **Pre-Implementation Checklist**

- [ ] Review existing code in: `src/mcp-server.ts`, `src/interfaces/mcp/`, `src/application/`
- [ ] Identify reusable components: Indexing workflow, monitoring workflow, MCP endpoints
- [ ] Check for similar patterns in: `src/domain/files/`, `src/infrastructure/storage/`
- [ ] Consider platform differences: Path handling for Windows vs Unix
- [ ] Review related tests: `tests/unit/mcp/`, `tests/integration/mcp/`

## üìã **Scope**

- [ ] Read folder list from configuration
- [ ] Apply folder-specific settings (model, excludes, etc.)
- [ ] Support folder configuration overrides
- [ ] Dynamic folder addition/removal
- [ ] Performance settings per folder
- [ ] Preserve existing endpoint functionality

## üìö **Essential Project Context**

### From Completed Work
- Phase 1-5: MCP endpoints, file processing, TUI framework  
- Current capabilities: 9 MCP endpoints, FAISS search, Ollama embeddings
- Task 6.1: Configuration System Foundation - provides config loading and validation
- Task 6.2: Basic Daemon Architecture - provides process management

### Critical Files to Understand
- `src/mcp-server.ts` - Current single-folder MCP server entry point
- `src/application/indexing/index.ts` - Indexing workflow to extend
- `src/application/monitoring/index.ts` - File monitoring workflow
- `src/interfaces/mcp/endpoints.ts` - MCP endpoint implementations
- `src/config/manager-refactored.ts` - Configuration manager to use
- `src/infrastructure/storage/StorageProvider.ts` - Vector storage handling

## üîó **Dependencies & Related Work**

### Prerequisite Tasks
- **Task 6.1**: Configuration System Foundation - Provides comprehensive config loading
- **Task 6.2**: Basic Daemon Architecture - Manages MCP server lifecycle

### Task Sequence
- **Previous**: Task 6.2 Basic Daemon Architecture - Created daemon to manage server
- **Current**: Task 6.3 Extend MCP Server for Multiple Folders - Adds multi-folder support
- **Next**: Task 6.4 Configuration-Aware CLI Commands - Will manage folders via CLI

## üìç **Context from Roadmap**

### Related User Stories
- **As a user, I want to add a folder to be shared**: `folder-mcp add ~/Documents`
- **As a user, I want to see all shared folders**: `folder-mcp list`

### Configuration System Design

**Example of issue being fixed**:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/user/Projects/folder-mcp/market_research.md'
Expected: /Users/user/Projects/folder-mcp/tests/fixtures/test-knowledge-base/Marketing/market_research.md
```

#### Additional Requirements
- **Real document processing**: Must successfully index actual business documents from test knowledge base
- **Path resolution**: Fix file parsing service path resolution for subdirectory files  
- **Error handling**: Proper error handling for indexing workflow failures
- **Statistics tracking**: Accurate progress and statistics with real files

### Test Validation Criteria
```bash
# These specific tests must pass after implementation:
npm test -- tests/integration/workflows/indexing-real-data.test.ts
# Expected: 0 failed, 8 passed

# Verify real document indexing works:
npm test -- tests/unit/domain/files.test.ts

- Progress tracking optimized for frequent updates without memory leaks
- Graceful degradation when folders become inaccessible

#### Assignment 5: Extend Monitoring Workflow ‚úÖ COMPLETED 2025-07-06

**Key Findings**:
- Successfully created comprehensive multi-folder monitoring system in `src/application/monitoring/multi-folder-monitoring.ts`
- Implemented dynamic folder management with configuration change detection
- Event aggregation system with cross-folder attribution and health monitoring
- Complete health monitoring system with recommendations and auto-resolution capabilities

**Decisions Made**:
- Used Map-based tracking for efficient folder watcher management
- Event aggregation with configurable history limits for memory management
- Health monitor with issue detection and auto-resolution recommendations
- Comprehensive status interfaces for monitoring and management UIs

**Architecture Insights**:
- Multi-folder monitoring cleanly abstracts single-folder monitoring workflows
- Health monitoring system provides actionable insights for system maintenance
- Event aggregation enables cross-folder analytics and troubleshooting
- Dynamic folder management supports hot configuration reloading

**System Features**:
- Folder health checking with automatic issue detection (inactive watchers, high error rates, queue backlogs)
- System resource monitoring (memory, CPU, file handles)
- Performance metrics tracking (processing times, events per second, restart frequency)
- Actionable health recommendations with automation flags

#### Assignment 6: Update MCP Endpoints ‚úÖ COMPLETED 2025-07-06

**Key Findings**:
- Successfully updated MCP endpoints to support multi-folder operations in `src/interfaces/mcp/endpoints.ts`
- Added backward compatibility layer for single-folder mode operation
- Enhanced search endpoint with folder filtering and multi-folder storage integration
- Created new `getFolderInfo` endpoint for comprehensive folder status and management

**Decisions Made**:
- Optional multi-folder services in constructor for backward compatibility
- Conditional routing: use multi-folder storage when available, fall back to single-folder
- Folder attribution in search results with proper metadata including source folder
- New endpoint for folder management without breaking existing API

**Architecture Insights**:
- Clean abstraction between single and multi-folder modes at interface layer
- Search endpoint naturally supports both folder-specific and cross-folder queries
- Document path resolution handles both legacy and multi-folder scenarios
- Result attribution maintains folder context for debugging and UI purposes

**API Enhancements**:
- Search endpoint respects `filters.folder` parameter for folder-specific searches
- `listFolders()` returns configured folders instead of directory listing
- `listDocuments()` uses folder manager to resolve folder paths correctly
- New `getFolderInfo()` provides comprehensive folder status, document counts, and settings
- All endpoints maintain backward compatibility with single-folder mode

#### Assignment 7: Update MCP Server Entry Point ‚úÖ COMPLETED 2025-07-06

**Key Findings**:
- Successfully updated MCP server entry point in `src/mcp-server.ts` to support both legacy and multi-folder modes
- Implemented intelligent mode detection based on command line arguments vs configuration
- Enhanced MCP tool definitions with folder filtering and new `get_folder_info` endpoint
- Proper initialization of multi-folder workflows for indexing and monitoring

**Decisions Made**:
- Backward compatibility layer: server still accepts single folder argument for legacy mode
- Multi-folder mode auto-detected when no command line argument provided
- Enhanced search tool with full parameter set including folder filtering
- Optional multi-folder service injection with graceful fallback to single-folder mode

**Architecture Insights**:
- Clean separation between legacy single-folder and new multi-folder initialization
- Service resolution handles missing multi-folder services gracefully
- Background processes (indexing, monitoring) automatically adapt to available services
- Proper shutdown handling for both single and multi-folder monitoring

**Server Enhancements**:
- Added `get_folder_info` tool for comprehensive folder status management
- Enhanced `search` tool with folder filtering, mode selection, and improved parameters
- Dual initialization paths: legacy mode vs configuration-driven multi-folder mode
- Graceful error handling and fallback behaviors for missing configuration
- Proper background process management with folder-aware initialization

#### Assignment 8: Migration and Compatibility ‚úÖ COMPLETED 2025-07-06

**Key Findings**:
- Created comprehensive migration system in `src/config/migration/folder-migration.ts`
- Built user-friendly CLI migration command in `src/interfaces/cli/commands/migrate.ts`
- Implemented intelligent detection of legacy vs multi-folder usage patterns
- Provided sample configuration generation and validation tools

**Decisions Made**:
- Backward compatibility built into MCP server entry point (Assignment 7)
- Migration helper generates YAML configuration files with proper structure
- CLI command provides dry-run, sample generation, and validation options
- Preserves existing configuration when migrating to avoid data loss

**Architecture Insights**:
- Migration system is completely optional - users can migrate when ready
- Configuration validation ensures generated configs meet schema requirements
- Sample configuration provides comprehensive examples of multi-folder setup
- CLI integration makes migration accessible through familiar command interface

**Migration Features**:
- Automatic detection of legacy single-folder command line usage
- Smart folder name generation from path when not specified
- Dry-run mode shows migration actions without making changes
- Sample configuration generation with comprehensive examples
- Configuration validation with detailed error reporting
- Preservation of existing multi-folder configuration during migration

### Platform-Specific Notes
[TRACK PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS]
- **Windows**: [Issues/solutions specific to Windows]
- **macOS**: [Issues/solutions specific to macOS]
- **Linux**: [Issues/solutions specific to Linux]

## üîç **Quick Reference**

### Key Commands
```bash
# Build and test
npm run build && npm test

# Run specific tests
npm test -- tests/unit/domain/folders
npm test -- tests/integration/multi-folder

# Test with configuration
FOLDER_MCP_CONFIG_PATH=./test-config.yaml npm run dev
```

### Common Issues
- **Path resolution**: Use path.resolve() for cross-platform
- **Home directory**: Expand ~ before validation
- **Folder permissions**: Check read access before indexing
- **Memory usage**: Multiple vector stores need management
