**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High (Must Have)

### Story 1.2: Context-Aware Memory Alerts

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Performance Impact**: Benchmark logging overhead before rollout
- **Log Volume Changes**: Monitor disk usage during transition  
- **Debugging Capability**: Ensure new logs provide better debugging than old system
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing log format during transition

## Notes for Sprint Planning

1. **Phase 1** focuses on the most critical issues that generate the most user complaints
2. **Story 3.1** (Log Level Audit) is large and may need to be broken down further
3. **Story 5.2** (Log Management) can be deferred if timeline is tight
4. Consider pairing developers for **Story 1.1** due to complexity of memory monitoring logic
5. **Story 2.1** should be completed before **Story 2.2** as it provides the foundation for request tracking
