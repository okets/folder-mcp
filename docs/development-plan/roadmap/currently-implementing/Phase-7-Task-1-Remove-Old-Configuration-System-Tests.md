# Task 7.1: Remove Old Configuration System Tests

**Phase**: 7 - Configuration System Overhaul  
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS  
**Created**: 2025-07-07  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Approach**: Clean slate - remove all tests related to the old 6-source configuration system to prepare for the new schema-driven approach

## üö® **MANDATORY ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This task plan contains MANDATORY architectural patterns that MUST be followed throughout implementation. These patterns are embedded in every assignment to ensure consistency during long implementation sessions.

### **üèóÔ∏è DI ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT**
Every service/manager/repository created MUST follow this pattern:

1. **Interface First** (Domain Layer):
   ```typescript
   // domain/[feature]/I[Service].ts
   export interface IService {
     method(): Promise<Result>;
   }
   ```

2. **Constructor Injection** (Application Layer):
   ```typescript
   // application/[feature]/[Service].ts
   export class Service implements IService {
     constructor(
       private readonly dep1: IDep1,
       private readonly dep2: IDep2
     ) {}
   }
   ```

3. **DI Registration** (DI Layer):
   ```typescript
   // di/setup.ts
   container.register<IService>('IService', {
     useClass: Service,
     lifecycle: Lifecycle.Singleton
   });
   ```

### **üìê Module Boundary Rules**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/        # Interfaces ONLY - no implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/   # Business logic with DI - no external dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/# External dependencies - no business logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ di/           # All service registrations - imports from all layers
```

### **‚úÖ VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (After EVERY Assignment)**
```bash
# 1. TypeScript MUST compile (ZERO errors)
npm run build
# Expected: "Found 0 errors"

# 2. Tests MUST pass
npm test -- tests/unit/[feature]
# Expected: All tests pass

# 3. DI Pattern Check
grep "constructor(" [new-service-file]
# Expected: Shows dependency parameters

# 4. No Direct Instantiation
grep -r "new [A-Z]" src/ --exclude-dir=di --exclude-dir=tests
# Expected: Only factories or DI container usage

# 5. Module Boundary Check
# Domain: Only interfaces
# Application: Business logic with DI
# Infrastructure: External deps only
# Interface: Thin layer, delegates to application
```

## üéØ **Task Objective**

Clean up all tests related to the old 6-source configuration system

## üîç **Pre-Implementation Checklist**

- [ ] Review existing code in: `tests/unit/config/`, `tests/integration/config/`, `tests/config/`
- [ ] Identify reusable components: Test utilities that can work with new system
- [ ] Check for similar patterns in: Other test directories that might use config
- [ ] Consider platform differences: N/A for test removal
- [ ] Review related tests: Integration tests that depend on configuration

## üìã **Scope**

- [ ] Remove tests for system config, profiles, environment expansion
- [ ] Remove tests for complex hierarchy merging
- [ ] Remove tests for hot reload of all sources
- [ ] Keep only tests that will be relevant to new system

## üìö **Essential Project Context**

### From Completed Work
- Phase 1-5: MCP endpoints, file processing, TUI framework  
- Phase 6: Built complex 6-source configuration system (now being replaced)
- Current capabilities: 9 MCP endpoints, FAISS search, Ollama embeddings

### Critical Files to Understand
- `tests/unit/config/` - Unit tests for configuration system
- `tests/integration/config/` - Integration tests for configuration
- `tests/config/` - Additional configuration tests
- `tests/integration/cli/config-commands.test.ts` - CLI configuration tests

## üîó **Dependencies & Related Work**

### Prerequisite Tasks
This is the first task in Phase 7, preparing the clean slate for the new configuration system.

### Task Sequence
- **Previous**: Phase 6 Task 6 - CLI/TUI Parity Validation (completed)
- **Current**: Remove Old Configuration System Tests - Clean up test suite
- **Next**: Task 7.2 - Simplify Current Configuration System - Create transitional JSON system

## üìç **Context from Roadmap**

### Related User Stories
- **As a user, I want simple configuration**: Just two YAML files with clear purpose
- **As a developer, I want clear separation**: System config vs user config with no overlap

### Configuration Requirements

#### User Configuration (config.yaml)
Not applicable for this task - we're removing old tests.

#### System Configuration (system-configuration.json)
Not applicable for this task - we're removing old tests.

#### Integration
This task clears the way for the new configuration system by removing outdated test assumptions.

### Implementation Details
From the configuration system design:
- Old system had 6 sources: defaults ‚Üí system ‚Üí user ‚Üí environment ‚Üí profiles ‚Üí runtime
- New system will have 2 files: config-defaults.yaml ‚Üí config.yaml
- Tests for the old complex hierarchy must be removed

## üîß **Implementation Assignments**

### Implementation Discoveries & Decision Log
**CRITICAL**: Update this section after EACH assignment completion:

#### üéØ **Key Decisions Made & Rationale**
- **[2025-07-07] Complete Removal Approach**: Decided to remove all old configuration tests completely
  - **Why**: Clean slate prevents confusion between old and new patterns
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Gradual migration, keeping some tests
  - **Impact**: Enables fresh implementation without legacy constraints

#### üê∞ **Rabbit Holes & Problem-Solving**
- **[2025-07-07] sed command issues**: Initial MultiEdit attempts failed due to formatting
  - **Time Spent**: 10 minutes
  - **Root Cause**: Line ending and whitespace differences
  - **Solution**: Used sed command-line tool for clean removal
  - **Prevention**: Consider using sed for bulk removals in future

#### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & DI Insights**
- **Test Organization**: Configuration tests were well-isolated in specific directories
- **No DI violations**: Old tests didn't violate current DI patterns (they predated DI)
- **Clean boundaries**: Test removal didn't affect other test suites

#### üìö **Unexpected Discoveries**
- **Test Count**: Found 11 complete test files dedicated to old config system
- **Profile References**: "profile" grep matched performance profiling (not config profiles)
- **Placeholder Tests**: `tests/integration/services/config.test.ts` contains only placeholders
- **Clean Removal**: No cascading dependencies - tests were well isolated

#### üîÑ **Plan Deviations & Adaptations**
- **Faster than Expected**: Task completed in 0.7 hours vs 5 hours estimated
- **More Files**: Found 11 files vs expected ~8 files
- **Clean Separation**: Old system was more isolated than expected

#### üé® **Reusable Patterns & Best Practices**
- **Removal Catalog**: Creating catalog document before removal helps track progress
- **sed for Bulk Edits**: More reliable than programmatic edits for large removals
- **Test Then Remove**: Running tests after each removal ensures stability

### DI Architecture Validation
Track DI compliance throughout implementation:

- **Services Created**: N/A (test removal only)
- **Interfaces Defined**: N/A (test removal only)
- **DI Registrations**: N/A (test removal only)
- **Dependency Chains**: N/A (test removal only)
- **Boundary Violations Fixed**: N/A (test removal only)

## üîç **Quick Reference**

### Key Commands
```bash
# Build and test (run after EVERY assignment)
npm run build && npm test

# Find configuration tests
find tests -name "*config*.test.ts" -type f

# Search for old patterns
grep -r "profile\|hierarchy\|system.*config" tests/ --include="*.test.ts"

# Run specific tests
npm test -- tests/unit/config
npm test -- tests/integration/config
```

### Common DI Issues and Solutions
- **Build errors**: Check interface imports and DI registrations
- **Test failures**: Verify mocks match interface contracts
- **Circular dependencies**: Review module organization
- **Missing registrations**: Check DI container setup

## üìù **Living Document Requirements**

**CRITICAL**: This task plan is a LIVING DOCUMENT that MUST be updated throughout implementation:

### After EACH Assignment:
1. **Update Status**: Change `[ ]` to `[x]` and add completion date
2. **Record Time**: Update "Actual" time in tracking table
3. **Document Discoveries**: Add findings to "Implementation Discoveries"
4. **Update DI Validation**: Record DI patterns used
5. **Commit Progress**: `git commit -m "Assignment N: [description]"`

### Completion Format:
```markdown
### Assignment N: [Name] ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Actual Time**: X hours (estimated Y hours)
**DI Patterns Used**: [List patterns implemented]
**Key Discoveries**: [What was learned]
**Code Locations**: [Files created/modified]
```

### üîç **Human Review Process** (Management-Style)

When this task is complete, provide the following information for human review:

#### **üìã Implementation Summary for Review**
```markdown
## Task Implementation Summary

### üéØ What Was Accomplished
- **Core Feature**: Removed all tests for the old 6-source configuration system
- **Key Components**: 
  - 11 test files completely removed from `tests/config/`
  - 2 integration test files removed
  - 1 test file modified (removed profile and env commands)
- **Integration Points**: Clean slate prepared for new configuration system

### üõ§Ô∏è Implementation Journey & Context
- **Approach Taken**: Complete removal approach - deleted all old test files
- **Key Decisions Made**: 
  - Remove completely rather than gradual migration
  - Keep only basic get/set/validate tests
  - Remove all profile and hierarchy concepts
- **Rabbit Holes Encountered**: 
  - MultiEdit formatting issues - solved with sed
  - False positives on "profile" search (performance profiling)
- **Alternative Approaches Considered**: 
  - Gradual migration (rejected - too complex)
  - Keeping some tests for reference (rejected - clean slate better)
- **Unexpected Discoveries**:
  - Old system was well-isolated (easy removal)
  - 11 complete test files dedicated to configuration
  - No cascading dependencies

### üß™ How to Verify This Works
**Quick Functional Test**:
```bash
# Verify old tests are gone
find tests -name "*profile*.test.ts" -o -name "*hierarchy*.test.ts" -o -name "*env-loader*.test.ts"
# Expected: No results

# Verify remaining tests pass
npm test
# Expected: 63 files, 723 tests passing
```

**Configuration Test**:
```bash
# Verify no old config references
grep -r "ConfigurationHierarchy\|ProfileManager\|SystemConfig" tests/
# Expected: No results

# Check remaining config tests
find tests -name "*config*.test.ts" -type f
# Expected: Only 2 files (config-commands.test.ts, services/config.test.ts)
```

### üîß Technical Validation Commands
```bash
# Build validation
npm run build
# Expected: 0 TypeScript errors

# Test suite health
npm test 2>&1 | grep -E "Test Files|Tests"
# Expected: Test Files  63 passed (63)

- **Dependencies**: Clean slate ready for new configuration
```

#### **üéØ Context-Aware Validation Commands**

**Build & Core Validation** (Always Required):
```bash
npm run build
# Expected: "Found 0 errors"

npm test
# Expected: All remaining tests pass
```

**Testing Tasks Only**:
```bash
# Verify test removal complete
find tests -name "*config*.test.ts" | xargs grep -l "profile\|hierarchy\|system.*config"
# Expected: No results or only simple config tests

# Check for orphaned imports
grep -r "import.*from.*config.*test" tests/
# Expected: No broken imports
```

## üîÑ **Phase Plan Update Process**

### When to Update Phase Plan

The phase plan MUST be updated when:
1. **Task Completion**: When marking a task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
2. **Before Commit**: After human review confirms task is complete
3. **Creating Next Task**: When previous task wasn't marked complete

### Phase Plan Update Instructions

When a task is marked complete, update the phase plan (`Phase-7-configuration-system-overhaul-plan.md`):

#### 1. **Update Phase Tasks Overview Table**
```markdown
| Task # | Task Name | Complexity | Status | Command |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Remove Old Configuration System Tests | Low | ‚úÖ | ~~`/create-task-plan 7 1`~~ |
| 2 | Simplify Current Configuration System | Medium | ‚è≥ | `/create-task-plan 7 2` |
```
Change status from ‚è≥ to ‚úÖ and strike through the command.

#### 2. **Update Phase Completion Log**
```markdown
### **Phase Completion Log**
| Task | Status | Completion Date | Key Decisions/Findings |
|------|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Task 1: Remove Old Configuration System Tests | ‚úÖ | 2025-07-07 | Removed 42 test files, kept 5 for adaptation |
| Task 2: Simplify Current Configuration System | ‚è≥ | - | - |
```

#### 3. **Update Progress Metrics**
```markdown
### **Linear Progress Bar**
```
‚ñ†‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ° 1/6 Tasks (17%)
```
```

## üìã **Configuration Pattern Examples**

### User Configuration Pattern (Schema-Driven)
Not applicable - this task removes old tests.

### System Configuration Pattern (Direct JSON)
Not applicable - this task removes old tests.

## üîÑ **Actionable Input Integration Workflow**

When human feedback is received during task review, follow this workflow:

### 1. **Categorize Feedback**
```markdown
## Human Feedback Received: [Date]

### Immediate Action Items (Address Before Continuing)
- [ ] [Feedback item that must be fixed now]
- [ ] [Another immediate issue]

### Future Phase Items (Address Later)  
- [ ] [Feedback for future consideration]
- [ ] [Enhancement suggestion for later phase]

### Clarification Needed
- [ ] [Question that needs human clarification]
```

### 2. **Update Plans Before Resuming**
**For Immediate Items**: Update this task plan with new assignments
**For Future Items**: Add to Phase plan or roadmap
**For Clarifications**: Document questions and wait for answers

### 3. **Implementation Strategy**
```markdown
## Feedback Integration Plan

### How Immediate Items Will Be Addressed:
1. [Describe approach for first immediate item]
2. [Describe approach for second immediate item]

### Timeline Impact:
- Original estimate: X hours
- Additional work: Y hours  
- New total: Z hours

### Dependencies Created:
- [What this feedback creates as dependencies for future work]
```

### 4. **Resume Coding Only After Planning**
- ‚úÖ All immediate feedback categorized
- ‚úÖ Implementation approach planned
- ‚úÖ Timeline updated
- ‚úÖ Dependencies documented
- ‚úÖ Human confirmation received (if needed)

**CRITICAL**: Never resume implementation until the feedback has been properly planned and the human has confirmed the approach.
