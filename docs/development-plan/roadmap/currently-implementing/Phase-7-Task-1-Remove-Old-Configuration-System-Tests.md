# Task 7.1: Remove Old Configuration System Tests

**Phase**: 7 - Configuration System Overhaul  
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS  
**Created**: 2025-07-07  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Approach**: Clean slate - remove all tests related to the old 6-source configuration system to prepare for the new schema-driven approach

## üö® **MANDATORY ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This task plan contains MANDATORY architectural patterns that MUST be followed throughout implementation. These patterns are embedded in every assignment to ensure consistency during long implementation sessions.

### **üèóÔ∏è DI ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT**
Every service/manager/repository created MUST follow this pattern:

1. **Interface First** (Domain Layer):
   ```typescript
   // domain/[feature]/I[Service].ts
   export interface IService {
     method(): Promise<Result>;
   }
   ```

2. **Constructor Injection** (Application Layer):
   ```typescript
   // application/[feature]/[Service].ts
   export class Service implements IService {
     constructor(
       private readonly dep1: IDep1,
       private readonly dep2: IDep2
     ) {}
   }
   ```

3. **DI Registration** (DI Layer):
   ```typescript
   // di/setup.ts
   container.register<IService>('IService', {
     useClass: Service,
     lifecycle: Lifecycle.Singleton
   });
   ```

### **üìê Module Boundary Rules**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/        # Interfaces ONLY - no implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/   # Business logic with DI - no external dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/# External dependencies - no business logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ di/           # All service registrations - imports from all layers
```

### **‚úÖ VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (After EVERY Assignment)**
```bash
# 1. TypeScript MUST compile (ZERO errors)
npm run build
# Expected: "Found 0 errors"

# 2. Tests MUST pass
npm test -- tests/unit/[feature]
# Expected: All tests pass

# 3. DI Pattern Check
grep "constructor(" [new-service-file]
# Expected: Shows dependency parameters

# 4. No Direct Instantiation
grep -r "new [A-Z]" src/ --exclude-dir=di --exclude-dir=tests
# Expected: Only factories or DI container usage

# 5. Module Boundary Check
# Domain: Only interfaces
# Application: Business logic with DI
# Infrastructure: External deps only
# Interface: Thin layer, delegates to application
```

## üéØ **Task Objective**

Clean up all tests related to the old 6-source configuration system

## üîç **Pre-Implementation Checklist**

- [ ] Review existing code in: `tests/unit/config/`, `tests/integration/config/`, `tests/config/`
- [ ] Identify reusable components: Test utilities that can work with new system
- [ ] Check for similar patterns in: Other test directories that might use config
- [ ] Consider platform differences: N/A for test removal
- [ ] Review related tests: Integration tests that depend on configuration

## üìã **Scope**

- [ ] Remove tests for system config, profiles, environment expansion
- [ ] Remove tests for complex hierarchy merging
- [ ] Remove tests for hot reload of all sources
- [ ] Keep only tests that will be relevant to new system

## üìö **Essential Project Context**

### From Completed Work
- Phase 1-5: MCP endpoints, file processing, TUI framework  
- Phase 6: Built complex 6-source configuration system (now being replaced)
- Current capabilities: 9 MCP endpoints, FAISS search, Ollama embeddings

### Critical Files to Understand
- `tests/unit/config/` - Unit tests for configuration system
- `tests/integration/config/` - Integration tests for configuration
- `tests/config/` - Additional configuration tests
- `tests/integration/cli/config-commands.test.ts` - CLI configuration tests

## üîó **Dependencies & Related Work**

### Prerequisite Tasks
This is the first task in Phase 7, preparing the clean slate for the new configuration system.

### Task Sequence
- **Previous**: Phase 6 Task 6 - CLI/TUI Parity Validation (completed)
- **Current**: Remove Old Configuration System Tests - Clean up test suite
- **Next**: Task 7.2 - Simplify Current Configuration System - Create transitional JSON system

## üìç **Context from Roadmap**

### Related User Stories
- **As a user, I want simple configuration**: Just two YAML files with clear purpose
- **As a developer, I want clear separation**: System config vs user config with no overlap

### Configuration Requirements

#### User Configuration (config.yaml)
Not applicable for this task - we're removing old tests.

#### System Configuration (system-configuration.json)
Not applicable for this task - we're removing old tests.

#### Integration
This task clears the way for the new configuration system by removing outdated test assumptions.

### Implementation Details
From the configuration system design:
- Old system had 6 sources: defaults ‚Üí system ‚Üí user ‚Üí environment ‚Üí profiles ‚Üí runtime
- New system will have 2 files: config-defaults.yaml ‚Üí config.yaml
- Tests for the old complex hierarchy must be removed

## üîß **Implementation Assignments**

find tests -name "*config*.test.ts" | wc -l
# Expected: Should match our list count

# Check for any missed references
grep -r "ConfigManager" tests/ --include="*.test.ts" | grep -v "SimpleConfigManager"
# Expected: All results should be in our removal list
```

#### **Implementation Notes**:
- Focus on tests that test the complexity we're removing
- Keep tests that test basic functionality we'll still need
- Document any tests that need modification rather than removal

#### **Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] All configuration test files identified

grep -r "ConfigurationHierarchy" tests/
# Expected: No results
```

### üîß Technical Validation Commands
```bash
# Build validation
npm run build
# Expected: 0 TypeScript errors

# Test suite health
npm test 2>&1 | grep -E "Test Files|Tests"
# Expected: X files, Y tests (document the new baseline)
```

### üß™ **Test Changes Summary**
**CRITICAL**: Document all test modifications for review and maintenance tracking.

#### **Tests Added**
N/A - This task only removes tests

#### **Tests Modified**
- `tests/integration/cli/config-commands.test.ts`: Removed profile and hierarchy tests
  - **Change Type**: Removed obsolete test cases
  - **Reason**: Profile system being removed
  - **Impact**: Reduced test count but maintained core functionality tests

#### **Tests Removed**
- `tests/unit/config/hierarchy.test.ts`: Complete removal
  - **Reason**: 6-source hierarchy being replaced with 2-file system
  - **Coverage Impact**: None - testing obsolete functionality
  - **Mitigation**: New tests will be added in Task 7.3

- `tests/unit/config/profiles.test.ts`: Complete removal
  - **Reason**: Profile system being eliminated
  - **Coverage Impact**: None - feature being removed
  
- `tests/unit/config/env-expansion.test.ts`: Complete removal
  - **Reason**: Complex env var expansion being simplified
  - **Coverage Impact**: Basic env var support will be tested in new system

- `tests/config/env-loader.test.ts`: Complete removal
  - **Reason**: Part of old 6-source system
  - **Coverage Impact**: None - being replaced

#### **Test Results Impact**
```bash
# Before task implementation
Test Files  X failed | Y passed | Z skipped (Total)
Tests       A failed | B passed | C skipped (Total)

# After task implementation  
Test Files  X failed | Y-N passed | Z skipped (Total-N)
Tests       A failed | B-M passed | C skipped (Total-M)

# Net change: Removed N test files, M individual tests
```

### üìö Key Learnings & Implications
- **Architecture Insights**: How deeply configuration was embedded
- **Future Impact**: Clean slate enables simpler implementation
- **Breaking Changes**: None - removing unused functionality
- **Test Coverage**: Temporary reduction until new tests added
- **Documentation Needs**: Update test documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Open Issues & Follow-Up Actions
- **Immediate**: Update test count baselines in CI/CD
- **Future Phase**: Add new configuration tests in Task 7.3
- **Dependencies**: Task 7.2 can now implement without test conflicts
```

#### **üéØ Context-Aware Validation Commands**

**Build & Core Validation** (Always Required):
```bash
npm run build
# Expected: "Found 0 errors"

npm test
# Expected: All remaining tests pass
```

**Testing Tasks Only**:
```bash
# Verify test removal complete
find tests -name "*config*.test.ts" | xargs grep -l "profile\|hierarchy\|system.*config"
# Expected: No results or only simple config tests

# Check for orphaned imports
grep -r "import.*from.*config.*test" tests/
# Expected: No broken imports
```

## üîÑ **Actionable Input Integration Workflow**

When human feedback is received during task review, follow this workflow:

### 1. **Categorize Feedback**
```markdown
## Human Feedback Received: [Date]

### Immediate Action Items (Address Before Continuing)
- [ ] [Feedback item that must be fixed now]
- [ ] [Another immediate issue]

### Future Phase Items (Address Later)  
- [ ] [Feedback for future consideration]
- [ ] [Enhancement suggestion for later phase]

### Clarification Needed
- [ ] [Question that needs human clarification]
```

### 2. **Update Plans Before Resuming**
**For Immediate Items**: Update this task plan with new assignments
**For Future Items**: Add to Phase plan or roadmap
**For Clarifications**: Document questions and wait for answers

### 3. **Implementation Strategy**
```markdown
## Feedback Integration Plan

### How Immediate Items Will Be Addressed:
1. [Describe approach for first immediate item]
2. [Describe approach for second immediate item]

### Timeline Impact:
- Original estimate: X hours
- Additional work: Y hours  
- New total: Z hours

### Dependencies Created:
- [What this feedback creates as dependencies for future work]
```

### 4. **Resume Coding Only After Planning**
- ‚úÖ All immediate feedback categorized
- ‚úÖ Implementation approach planned
- ‚úÖ Timeline updated
- ‚úÖ Dependencies documented
- ‚úÖ Human confirmation received (if needed)

**CRITICAL**: Never resume implementation until the feedback has been properly planned and the human has confirmed the approach.
