# Phase 8: Unified Application Flow Implementation Plan

**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Approach**: Dynamic/Exploratory - Tasks defined as discovered  

## üéØ **Phase Overview**

Create a unified application flow that combines the GUI, daemon control, and all existing components into a cohesive, production-ready application.

### **Core Goals**
- **Unified Entry Point**: Single `folder-mcp` command that intelligently routes to appropriate interface
- **Seamless Integration**: All components work together as one cohesive system
- **Production Polish**: Handle edge cases, errors, and unexpected states gracefully
- **User Experience**: Intuitive flow from installation to daily use
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users see immediate results of their actions
- **Persistent Service**: Daemon architecture that survives TUI sessions

### **Success Criteria**
- Single command launches complete experience
- All components integrated and communicating
- Graceful error handling throughout
- Clear user feedback for all operations
- Production-ready stability

## üèóÔ∏è **Implementation Strategy**

### **Dynamic Task Discovery**
This phase uses an exploratory approach where tasks are discovered and documented as we progress through the integration work. Each task will be added to this document as it's identified, creating a living record of the unification process.

### **Core Philosophy**
- **Integration First**: Connect what exists before adding new features
- **User Journey**: Follow the user's path to discover pain points
- **Iterative Refinement**: Quick iterations with continuous improvement
- **Document as We Go**: Capture decisions and discoveries in real-time

## üö® **PHASE 8 WORKING RULES**

### 1. **DELETE, DON'T MIGRATE**
- We are pre-production - no migration plans needed
- Replace old functionality completely
- Delete obsolete code immediately
- We are not a code museum!

### 2. **ZERO TECHNICAL DEBT**
- NO mockups
- NO stubs
- NO simulations
- NO "TODO"s in the code
- Implement it properly or don't implement it at all

### 3. **ALL TESTS MUST PASS**
- `npm test` must always show 100% passing
- If a test fails:
  - Irrelevant test? DELETE IT
  - Relevant test? FIX THE CODE
- No skipped tests, no commented tests

### 4. **MAINTAIN ARCHITECTURE**
- Every task respects module boundaries
- Proper dependency injection throughout
- No shortcuts that break clean architecture
- Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Interface separation

## üìã **Dynamic Task List**

*Tasks will be added here as they are discovered during implementation*

### Discovered Tasks:
<!-- Tasks will be documented here as they emerge -->

### Final Task (Predefined):
- **Update Roadmap Document**: 
  1. Document Phase 8 summary in `docs/development-plan/roadmap/folder-mcp-roadmap-1.1.md`
  2. Update future phases if we've completed their work in Phase 8
  3. Adjust upcoming phase instructions based on Phase 8 practices

## üìä **Progress Tracking**

### **Discovered Tasks Log**
| Task # | Task Description | Discovered Date | Status | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| - | *Tasks will be logged as discovered* | - | - | - |
| Final | Update Roadmap Document | 2025-07-08 | ‚è≥ | Predefined |

### **Key Discoveries**
*Document important findings, decisions, and pivots as they occur*

### **Integration Points**
*Track which components were connected and how*

## üîç **Phase-Specific Context**

### Why Dynamic Approach?
Integration phases are inherently exploratory. As we connect components, we discover:
- Missing interfaces between systems
- Unexpected edge cases
- User experience gaps
- Performance considerations
- Error scenarios that need handling

By keeping the task list dynamic, we can:
- Respond to discoveries quickly
- Avoid over-planning for unknown problems
- Focus on real issues vs theoretical ones
- Maintain development momentum

### Documentation Commitment
While tasks are dynamic, documentation is critical:
- Each discovered task gets documented immediately
- Decisions and rationale captured in real-time
- Problems and solutions recorded for future reference
- Final roadmap update consolidates all learnings

## ‚úÖ **Phase Validation**

### Continuous Validation
- After each task: Verify integration still works
- Regular user flow testing
- Performance monitoring
- Error scenario testing

### Final Validation
- Complete user journey test
- All components working together
- Documentation complete
- Roadmap updated
