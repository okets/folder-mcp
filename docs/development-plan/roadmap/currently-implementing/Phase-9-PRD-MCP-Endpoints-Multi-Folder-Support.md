# Phase 9: MCP Endpoints Multi-Folder Support

**Status**: 📋 PLANNED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Approach**: Endpoint-by-Endpoint Implementation

**🚀 Implementation Plan**: [Phase 9 Simple SCRUM Plan](./Phase-9-Implementation-epic.md)  

## 🎯 **Overview**

Update our existing MCP endpoints to work with the multi-folder indexing system. The core change: **transition from single-folder to multi-folder operations** while maintaining the same excellent endpoint interface.

## 🌟 **The Problem**

Our MCP endpoints currently expect a single folder and model. With Task 11.5 complete, we now have:
- Multiple folders with different models
- Folder lifecycle states (pending → active → error)
- Path-aware topic detection (prerequisite)

**The endpoints need to be updated to work with this new reality.**

## 🎯 **Vision**

Keep our excellent 10-endpoint interface, but make each endpoint **folder-aware** and **state-aware**:
- LLMs specify which folder to operate on
- Endpoints validate folder states before operations
- Responses include folder context and attribution
- Model loading happens automatically per folder

---

## 📡 **Endpoint Changes Required**

### 1. **`search` Endpoint**
**Current**: Searches the single configured folder
**Required Changes**:

- **Include folder attribution in results**
- **Return folder-specific error messages** when folder unavailable

**New Request Schema**:
```json
{
  "query": "quadratic equations",
  "folder": "MathCourse",  // NEW: Required parameter
  "mode": "semantic",
  "limit": 10
}
```

**New Response Addition**:
```json
{
  "folderContext": {
    "name": "MathCourse",
    "path": "/Users/bob/MathCourse",
    "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",

## 🎭 **Updated User Experience**

### For LLMs (Primary Users)

**Step 1: Discover Available Folders**
```
LLM calls: getFolderInfo()
LLM sees: 3 active folders with topic hints
```

**Step 2: Select Appropriate Folder**
```
User: "Find quadratic equations"
LLM: Sees MathCourse has topic "algebra, equations" 
LLM calls: search({ folder: "MathCourse", query: "quadratic equations" })
```

**Step 3: Handle Folder Issues**
```
LLM calls: search({ folder: "ChemistryCourse", query: "..." })
Response: "Folder ChemistryCourse is currently indexing (65% complete)"
LLM: "The Chemistry folder is still being indexed. Try again in a few minutes?"
```

### For End Users
- **Transparent folder management** - LLM handles the complexity
- **Clear error messages** when folders unavailable  
- **Automatic folder selection** based on topic matching
- **Progress visibility** for folders being indexed

## 📋 **Implementation Phases** (Easiest to Hardest)

### Phase 1: MCP Server → Daemon Architecture Fix 🚨 *CRITICAL FOUNDATION*

**Goal**: Connect MCP server to daemon instead of direct file access

**The Problem**: Current MCP server takes folder path as argument and operates independently:
```
BROKEN: Claude → MCP Server → Direct File Access (single folder only)
```

**The Solution**: MCP server becomes a thin client connecting to daemon:
```
FIXED: Claude → MCP Server → WebSocket → Daemon → Multi-Folder System
```

**Specific Tasks**:
1. **Remove folder arguments** from MCP server entry point (`mcp-server.ts`)
2. **Add WebSocket client** to MCP server for daemon communication
3. **Create daemon API endpoints** for MCP operations
4. **Implement protocol translation** - MCP calls ↔ Daemon API calls
5. **Test architecture** - Verify MCP server connects to daemon successfully

**Architecture Verification Test**:
```bash
# 1. Start daemon (manages all folders)
npm run daemon

# 2. Start MCP server (no folder arguments!)
node dist/mcp-server.js  # Connects to daemon via WebSocket

# 3. Test connection
Agent calls: get_status → MCP Server → Daemon → Returns system info
```

**Success Criteria**:
- MCP server starts WITHOUT folder path arguments
- WebSocket connection established to daemon
- MCP calls successfully forwarded to daemon
- Daemon responses properly returned to MCP clients
- UI folder changes immediately visible to MCP clients

### Phase 2: "Hello World" - Status Endpoint ⭐ *FIRST REAL TEST*

**Goal**: Get a single endpoint working with multi-folder data via daemon

**Why `get_status` first**:
- No folder parameters required - simplest interface change
- No model loading - no complex dependencies  
- No state validation - just read current system state from daemon
- Perfect for testing MCP→Daemon→Multi-Folder flow

**Specific Tasks**:
1. **Implement daemon status API** - Return multi-folder system info
2. **Connect MCP endpoint to daemon** - Forward get_status calls
3. **Test with agent** - Verify endpoint responds with multi-folder data via daemon
4. **Validate JSON structure** - Ensure response format is correct

**"Hello World" Test Case**:
```bash
# Agent calls: get_status
# MCP Server → Daemon API → Multi-folder status
# Expected response includes:
{
  "systemStatus": "healthy",
  "totalFolders": 3,
  "activeFolders": 2,
  "indexingFolders": 1,
  "errorFolders": 0
  // ... basic multi-folder awareness from daemon
}
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- Agent can successfully call `get_status` endpoint
- MCP server forwards call to daemon successfully
- Response includes multi-folder system information from daemon
- No crashes or MCP protocol errors
- Foundation established for other endpoints

### Phase 3: Read-Only Multi-Folder Endpoints  
- **Enhance `get_folder_info`** - Forward to daemon for all folders with topics
- **Update `list_documents`** - Forward to daemon for folder-specific document lists
- **Test agent navigation** - Agent can discover folders and their contents via daemon

### Phase 4: Folder-Aware Document Retrieval
- **Update `get_document_outline`** - Forward to daemon with folder-aware document paths
- **Update `get_document_data`** - Forward to daemon with folder resolution
- **Update format endpoints** (`get_sheet_data`, `get_slides`, `get_pages`) - Forward to daemon

### Phase 5: Complex Search Endpoint
- **Add folder parameter to `search`** - Forward to daemon with folder specification
- **Daemon handles model switching** - Load correct model per folder in daemon
- **Daemon handles state validation** - Only search active folders
- **Performance optimization** - Model caching and efficient switching in daemon

### Phase 6: End-to-End Integration (Built Throughout)
- **Daemon API design** - RESTful/WebSocket API for all MCP operations
- **Error handling** - Proper error propagation from daemon to MCP clients
- **Performance monitoring** - Track MCP→Daemon→Response latency
- **Protocol compliance** - Ensure all MCP responses meet specification

---

## 🧪 **Verified TMOAT Methodology**

*Each implementation phase MUST be verified through subagent testing before moving to the next phase.*

### **Testing Infrastructure Setup**

**Step 1: Start Daemon + MCP Server Architecture**
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# 1. Start daemon first (manages all folders)
npm run daemon
# Daemon reads folders from ~/.folder-mcp/config.yaml

# 2. Configure Claude Code to use folder-mcp (NO folder arguments!)
# Add to Claude Desktop config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "folder-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/dist/mcp-server.js"
        // ✅ NO folder paths! MCP server connects to daemon
      ]
    }
  }
}

# 3. MCP server automatically connects to daemon via WebSocket
# All folder configuration managed by daemon
```

**Step 2: Configure Test Folders in Daemon**
```bash
# Configure daemon with test folders (not MCP server!)
folder-mcp config set folders.list '[
  {
    "path": "tests/fixtures/test-knowledge-base/Sales",
    "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  },
  {
    "path": "tests/fixtures/test-knowledge-base/Legal", 
    "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  }
]'

# Daemon immediately picks up config changes
# All MCP clients automatically see new folders
```

**Step 3: Create Testing Subagent**
```typescript
// Use Task tool to create a subagent with MCP access
const testAgent = await Task({
  description: "MCP Endpoint Tester",
  prompt: "You are testing the folder-mcp endpoints. Use the MCP tools to query the system.",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
});
```

**Step 4: Verification Pattern**
- **Act as User**: You know what's in daemon config and test fixtures
- **Ask Known Questions**: Query for information you already know exists
- **Verify Responses**: Check if agent gets correct answers via MCP→Daemon flow

### **Phase 1 TMOAT: Architecture Connection Verification**

**Test Scenario 1: MCP Server Connects to Daemon**
```
USER (You): "Check if the MCP server is working"
EXPECTED: Agent calls get_status()
VERIFY: 
- MCP server connects to daemon successfully
- No "connection refused" errors
- Response comes from daemon (not direct file access)
```

**Test Scenario 2: Daemon Configuration Visibility**
```
USER: "What folders are available?"
EXPECTED: Agent calls get_status() or get_folder_info()
VERIFY:
- Response shows folders from daemon config
- NOT hardcoded folder paths from MCP args
- Daemon manages folder list
```

### **Phase 2 TMOAT: Status Endpoint Verification**

**Test Scenario 1: Basic System Status**
```
USER (You): "Check the MCP server status"
EXPECTED: Agent calls get_status()
VERIFY: Response includes systemStatus, totalFolders, activeFolders
```

**Test Scenario 2: Multi-Folder Awareness**
```
USER: "How many folders are configured in the system?"
EXPECTED: Agent calls get_status()
VERIFY: 
- totalFolders matches actual config count
- activeFolders shows correctly indexed folders
- errorFolders shows any failed folders
```

**Known Test Data** (from fixtures):
- Folders: `Sales/`, `Engineering/`, `Legal/`
- Total documents: ~15-20 files
- File types: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX

### **Phase 3 TMOAT: Folder Discovery (via Daemon)**

**Test Scenario 1: List All Folders from Daemon**
```
USER: "What folders are available to search?"
EXPECTED: Agent calls get_folder_info()
VERIFY:
- MCP Server → Daemon API → Folder list
- Returns Sales, Legal folders from daemon config
- Each folder shows document count from daemon
- Topics are displayed for each folder (from daemon's topic detection)
```

**Test Scenario 2: Document Listing via Daemon**
```
USER: "Show me all documents in the Sales folder"
EXPECTED: Agent calls list_documents(folder: "Sales")
VERIFY:
- MCP Server forwards request to Daemon
- Daemon returns Sales folder document list
- Lists Sales_Pipeline.xlsx, Q4_Board_Deck.pptx
- Shows correct file metadata from daemon
```

### **Phase 4 TMOAT: Document Retrieval (via Daemon)**

**Test Scenario 1: Get Specific Document via Daemon**
```
USER: "Get the outline of Q4_Board_Deck.pptx"
EXPECTED: Agent calls get_document_outline(document_id: "Sales/Q4_Board_Deck.pptx")
VERIFY:
- MCP Server forwards to Daemon document service
- Daemon processes document using its file parsing service
- Returns slide count (45 slides) from daemon
- Shows slide titles from daemon processing
- File size is correct from daemon metadata
```

**Test Scenario 2: Extract Spreadsheet Data via Daemon**
```
USER: "Show me the data from Sales_Pipeline.xlsx"
EXPECTED: Agent calls get_sheet_data(document_id: "Sales/Sales_Pipeline.xlsx")
VERIFY:
- MCP Server → Daemon API → Document processing
- Daemon parses spreadsheet using its services
- Returns sheet names from daemon
- Shows headers: Month, Revenue, Profit from daemon
- Contains Q4 data rows processed by daemon
```

### **Phase 5 TMOAT: Search Operations (via Daemon)**

**Test Scenario 1: Semantic Search Within Folder via Daemon**
```
USER: "Search for Q4 revenue information in the Sales folder"
EXPECTED: Agent calls search(query: "Q4 revenue", folder: "Sales", mode: "semantic")
VERIFY:
- MCP Server forwards to Daemon search service
- Daemon loads correct model for Sales folder
- Daemon performs semantic search in Sales folder only
- Returns Sales_Pipeline.xlsx as top result from daemon
- Returns Q4_Board_Deck.pptx as second result from daemon
- Similarity scores > 0.8 from daemon's model
```

**Test Scenario 2: Cross-Folder Awareness (Negative Test) via Daemon**
```
USER: "Search for contracts in the Sales folder"
EXPECTED: Agent calls search(query: "contracts", folder: "Sales", mode: "semantic")
VERIFY:
- MCP Server → Daemon search service
- Daemon searches ONLY Sales folder as requested
- Returns no results from daemon (contracts are in Legal folder)
- Agent suggests searching Legal folder instead
```

**Test Scenario 3: Dynamic Configuration Test**
```
USER: "Add a new folder via TUI, then search it"
STEPS:
1. Use TUI to add new folder to daemon config
2. Agent calls get_folder_info() immediately after
VERIFY:
- New folder appears in MCP client immediately
- No need to restart MCP server or update Claude config
- Daemon configuration changes propagate to all MCP clients
```

### **Success Criteria for Each Phase**

**Phase 1 Success (Architecture Fix)**:
✅ MCP server starts WITHOUT folder path arguments
✅ WebSocket connection established between MCP server and daemon
✅ MCP calls successfully forwarded to daemon
✅ Daemon responses properly returned to MCP clients
✅ UI folder changes immediately visible to MCP clients

**Phase 2 Success (Status Endpoint)**:
✅ Subagent successfully connects to MCP server
✅ MCP server forwards get_status calls to daemon
✅ Daemon returns multi-folder information via MCP server
✅ No protocol errors or crashes
✅ Response times < 500ms for MCP→Daemon→Response

**Phase 3 Success (Folder Discovery)**:
✅ Agent discovers all folders configured in daemon
✅ Document counts are accurate from daemon
✅ Topics reflect actual folder content from daemon's detection
✅ Can list documents in specific folders via daemon

**Phase 4 Success (Document Retrieval)**:
✅ Document outlines return correct structure from daemon
✅ Spreadsheet data is accessible via daemon processing
✅ PDF/PPTX metadata is accurate from daemon parsing
✅ Folder context included in responses from daemon

**Phase 5 Success (Search Operations)**:
✅ Semantic search returns relevant results from daemon
✅ Folder filtering works correctly in daemon
✅ Model switching happens transparently in daemon
✅ Performance < 2s for MCP→Daemon→Search→Response
✅ Dynamic folder configuration works without MCP server restart

### **TMOAT Execution Commands**

```bash
# 1. Build and start daemon + MCP server architecture
npm run build

# 2. Start daemon first (manages all folders)
npm run daemon
# Daemon loads config from ~/.folder-mcp/config.yaml

# 3. Configure test folders in daemon
folder-mcp config set folders.list '[
  {
    "path": "tests/fixtures/test-knowledge-base/Sales",
    "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  }
]'

# 4. Start MCP server (connects to daemon, NO folder arguments)
node dist/mcp-server.js
# MCP server connects to daemon via WebSocket

# 5. Launch subagent tester
npm run test:mcp-agent

# 6. Monitor daemon and MCP communication
tail -f logs/daemon.log
tail -f logs/mcp-server.log

# 7. Verify each phase before proceeding
npm run verify:phase1  # Architecture connection works
npm run verify:phase2  # Status endpoint via daemon works
npm run verify:phase3  # Folder discovery via daemon works
# etc.
```

### **Red Flags to Watch For**

**Phase 1 Architecture Issues**:
⚠️ **Connection Failures**: MCP server can't connect to daemon WebSocket
⚠️ **Direct File Access**: MCP server bypassing daemon (old behavior)
⚠️ **Hardcoded Paths**: MCP server still expecting folder arguments
⚠️ **Port Conflicts**: Daemon and MCP server WebSocket port issues

**Phase 2+ Endpoint Issues**:
⚠️ **Protocol Violations**: Invalid JSON-RPC responses from MCP↔Daemon
⚠️ **Missing Folder Context**: Responses without folder attribution from daemon
⚠️ **Wrong Model Usage**: Daemon using single model for all folders
⚠️ **State Confusion**: Daemon allowing searches on inactive/error folders
⚠️ **Performance Issues**: MCP→Daemon→Response > 5 seconds
⚠️ **Memory Leaks**: Growing memory in daemon with repeated MCP calls
⚠️ **Config Sync Issues**: UI changes not propagating to MCP clients
⚠️ **Daemon Restart Required**: Configuration changes requiring daemon restarts

## 🧠 **Path-Aware Topic Detection Approach**

*This clustering enhancement is a prerequisite that must be implemented first to enable rich folder metadata for the endpoints.*

### Key Design Decisions

**Subfolder Intelligence**:
- Documents in same subfolder get 20% similarity boost during clustering
- Subfolder names weighted 5x in topic term extraction (e.g., "Algebra/" becomes primary cluster term)
- No database hierarchy storage - extract subfolder from document paths on-demand

**File Name Pattern Recognition**:
- Detect sequences (`HW1`, `HW2`, `HW3`), prefixes (`Algebra_`, `Statistics_`), categories (`exam`, `lab`, `notes`)
- Sequential files get 10% similarity boost, same prefix gets 20% boost  
- Common file patterns become cluster terms with high weight

**Database-Powered Evolution**:
- Cache cluster centroids and term frequencies for fast incremental updates (~50ms classification)
- New topic detection: documents with <40% similarity queue for new cluster creation
- Quality monitoring: detect cluster drift, trigger recomputation when coherence drops below 0.7
- Evolution tracking: log when clusters split, merge, or adapt to content changes

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Document classification: <100ms using cached centroids
- New cluster creation: <5s from 5+ queued documents
- Topic retrieval: <50ms from database cache  
- Full reclustering only when >20% of documents change or quality degrades

### Why This Matters for Endpoints

This approach generates **intelligent folder topics** that the `get_folder_info` endpoint will return to help LLMs make smart folder selection decisions. Topics like `["algebra", "quadratic", "homework"]` are much more useful than generic content clusters.

---

## ⚠️ **Prerequisites**

1. **Task 11.5 Complete**: Multi-folder indexing system working
2. **Path-Aware Topic Detection**: Implement clustering approach above
3. **Database Schema**: Cluster centroids, topic storage, and evolution tracking available  
4. **Model Registry**: System tracks which model each folder uses
