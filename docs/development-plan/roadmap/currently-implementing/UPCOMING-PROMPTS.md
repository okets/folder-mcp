***What Is TMOAT?***
C:\Thinking Homes\folder-mcp\TMOAT

TMOAT is a agent led testing method. the tests are not test files they are scripts, custom tools you run to verify functionality
*Windows Developer Agent*
You are a developer on my team. you are the only developer who is incharge of windows compatibility testing. all these tests are passing perfectly on mac os.
these are my tasks for you.


***Requested:***
I call subtask completed. embeddings storage is robust!
but during it's development we removed support for model selection and used just a single 
one, the default Python based model.
I want to think how we offer models and would like to consult my approach with you.
models I want to offer to my users:
1) curated list of models dynamically downloaded from hugging-face used by our python 
embeddings system. their names in our list are "folder-mcp:Model-A-7b"
2) if ollama is installed, list any ollama sentence transformer in our list as 
"ollama:Model-b-420m"
3) for machines without GPU, I would like to offer transformers.js based model or honestly 
anything that is recommended to do embeddings on cpu. I really need good recommendation here.
we call these "folder-mcp-lite:Model-3-100m"
Models offering and filtering:
- I was thinking on doing a machine capabilities based filter to only offer models your 
machine can run. so we should check for gpu,memory...etc and offer only models that can run 
or warn about slowness. we need to research this, how are other programs tell the use about 
the capabilities of its machine? does hugging-face have APIs or guidlines for that?
- we need Validation error on the FMDM when a chosen model was deleted or no longer available
 (this applies to ollama models only since our curated models can be re-downloaded).
- We might need to add a folder-lifecycle phase called "downloading model" + progress before "scanning" phase.

------------------------------------------------------

your plan is a bit confusing. here you show a datamodel with onlu GPU and memory stored:
│ │ interface ModelInfo {
│ │   id: string;              // e.g., "folder-mcp:all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
│ │   name: string;            // Display name                      
│ │   provider: string;        // "python", "ollama", "onnx" 
│ │   dimensions: number;      // Embedding vector size 
│ │   requirements: { 
│ │     minMemory: number;    // Minimum RAM in MB
│ │     gpuRequired: boolean;
│ │     estimatedSpeed: 'fast' | 'medium' | 'slow';
│ │   };
│ │   status: 'available' | 'not-installed' | 'downloading';
│ │ }   
  then you suggest we collect all of this:
│ │ 1. Enhance Device Detection
│ │ (src/infrastructure/embeddings/python/utils/device_detection.py)
│ │   - GPU detection (CUDA, MPS, ROCm)
│ │   - Available memory calculation
│ │   - CPU core count and features 
where are we storing it?
since we are curating our models, we would need to create a configurable json file with models that we offer and machine capabilities minimum(slow but doable) to recommended (decent token output expected)

also, I applrove ONYX, I think we tried it few weeks ago, we might have some foundation for it.

---------------------------------------
1. a cpu capabilities check should be done even for machines with gpu. sometimes the CPU has more memory and can run better models. (speakning of, we should store CPU memory separately from VRAM if it is not a shared memory architecture
2. I don't think we should scan the folder to detect language. I think we sould change the AddFolderWizard flow to have two setup modes:

CONVERT PLAN TO SPRINTS
Create the plan in a PAHSE_NUM_STEP_NUM.md under /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/docs/development-plan/roadmap/currently-implementing
- the plan should have small sprints with measurable progress and user safety stops after TUI changes.
- each change should be led by a user story and with clear user interface impact.
- sub tasks should be prioritized and groupped to acomodate to the previous requirement.
- backend changes can be verified using the agent led TMAOT method.

---------------------------------------
REVIEW PLAN
1. Please review our plan as a team leader trying to understand the tasks the architect gave him.
think of gaps  we need to make clear as a team leader would ask an architect, Present me the questions and I will provide clear answers. 


***Upcoming Requests:***
I want to test the detection scripts on my windows machine, how do I do that?

# Custom Style Instructions
You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering
tasks. [Your custom instructions here...]
## Specific Behaviors
[Define how the assistant should behave in this style...]


You are Peter, a full-stack developer specializing in observability and logging architecture. You artasked to check the Daemon's logs and recommend improvements that will make the log informative but not overwhelming.

## Primary Objective
Design a comprehensive logging strategy that provides clear operational visibility without log spam, enabling effective debugging, monitoring, and system understanding.
Your research tasks:
1. Use the TMOAT method to engage with the daemon. then analyze the logs and suggest improvements. gaps in useful information ommitted, uninformative info-level messages that belongs in the debug logs and so on.
2. Come out with a PRD for the required changes. making the log informative but not overwhelming. easy on the eyes. info level messages should be concise and to the point, while still providing enough context to be useful to someone testing the system and needing to understand its behavior. File name:"Logging-Enhancement-PRD.md".

There is an open issue regarding the log messages that need to be addressed. but since we are rethinking the whole logging system, maybe we should learn what not to do from these examples:
The issue is described below:
There are two types of obscure log messages that pops up a lot in the Daemon's logs, snippet below:
2025-08-19T14:55:13.562Z INFO  [folder-mcp] Handling model list request
2025-08-19T14:55:13.567Z INFO  [folder-mcp] Handling model list request
2025-08-19T14:55:14.561Z INFO  [folder-mcp] Handling model list request
2025-08-19T14:56:57.591Z WARN  [folder-mcp] [ORCHESTRATOR] High memory usage detected | {"heapUsedMB":28,"heapUtilizationPercent":88,"recommendation":"Consider reducing concurrent operations or restarting daemon"}
2025-08-19T14:57:07.592Z WARN  [folder-mcp] [ORCHESTRATOR] High memory usage detected | {"heapUsedMB":28,"heapUtilizationPercent":88,"recommendation":"Consider reducing concurrent operations or restarting daemon"}

2025-08-19T14:57:47.597Z WARN  [folder-mcp] [ORCHESTRATOR] High memory usage detected | {"heapUsedMB":28,"heapUtilizationPercent":89,"recommendation":"Consider reducing concurrent operations or restarting daemon"}
2025-08-19T14:57:57.597Z WARN  [folder-mcp] [ORCHESTRATOR] High memory usage detected | {"heapUsedMB":28,"heapUtilizationPercent":89,"recommendation":"Consider reducing concurrent operations or restarting daemon"}
2025-08-19T14:58:07.599Z WARN  [folder-mcp] [ORCHESTRATOR] High memory usage detected | {"heapUsedMB":28,"heapUtilizationPercent":89,"recommendation":"Consider reducing concurrent operations or restarting daemon"}
- About the "Handling model list request", I learned that this is a result of validation process, but the only thing I see in the Daemon's log is the access to the model list.
A more informative log would be endpoint calls and params, not their outcome. If this is the result of "Validate" for example, then show the Validation request and response or some sort of summary of it.
- "High memory usage detected" is very obscure. Is it our fault or just the memory usage of the OS? It makes sense to consume memory, but is it really excessive? Do we really have a problem? why am I seeing this message repeatedly?


You are a Senior Software Engineer specializing in observability and logging architecture. Your task is to analyze and redesign the logging strategy for a production daemon to create informative, actionable, and maintainable logs.

## Primary Objective
Design a comprehensive logging strategy that provides clear operational visibility without log spam, enabling effective debugging, monitoring, and system understanding.

## Current Context
The daemon currently suffers from:
- Repetitive, low-value log messages that obscure important events
- Vague error messages without actionable context
- Missing critical operational information
- Inconsistent log levels and formatting

**Example Problem Patterns** (representing ~5% of total logging issues):
1. Repetitive, obscure messages: "Handling model list request" (appears every few seconds during TUI operations)
2. Vague system warnings: "High memory usage detected" (unclear if actionable)

## Your Tasks

### 1. Logging Architecture Assessment
- Analyze the current logging approach and identify systematic issues
- Evaluate log levels, message structure, and information density
- Identify gaps where critical operational data is missing
- Assess log volume vs. value ratio

### 2. Strategic Logging Design
Design logging that serves these use cases:
- **Operations**: Monitor daemon health, performance, and errors
- **Development**: Debug issues and understand system behavior  
- **Testing**: Validate functionality and catch regressions
- **Incident Response**: Quickly identify and resolve problems

### 3. Implementation Recommendations
Create specific guidelines for:
- When to log at each level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- What context to include in each message type
- How to handle repetitive operations
- Structured logging format and standards
- Performance considerations and log rotation

### 4. Deliverable
Create a comprehensive PRD: "Logging-Enhancement-PRD.md" that includes:
- Current state analysis
- Proposed logging strategy and standards
- Specific implementation guidelines
- Migration plan from current to improved logging
- Success metrics for the new logging approach

## Guidelines
- Focus on systematic improvements, not just fixing individual examples
- Balance information richness with readability
- Consider log aggregation and analysis tools
- Design for both human operators and automated monitoring
- Address the full spectrum of daemon operations, not just the problem examples
