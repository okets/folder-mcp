***after indexing process is perfected, I want to work on the available models lists:***
- I want to discuss the list of sentence transformers we are about to offer. We need to list existing ollama sentence transformers the user might have installed.
As for our python offerings, I want to offer few, but I don’t want to download all of them, just cache them as they first download.
- Validation error on the FMDM when a chosen model was deleted (llama only our models can be re-downloaded).

- I want to discuss multiple systems for embeddings support, Ollama/folder-mcp python/transformers.js

***Next:***
1. can we run the daemon using 'npm run daemon' instead of 'node dist/src/daemon/index.js'? how will the --restart flag work?

2. why is it that the text on the screen cannot be selected lately? even if nothing on the screen refreshes, the selection from the TUI is nearly impossible as the text is being refreshed. but why? no char changes occured.
