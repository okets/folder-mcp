**THIS FILE IS WHERE I STACK MY UPCOMING PROMPTS**

***after indexing process is perfected, I want to work on the available models lists:***
- I want to discuss the list of sentence transformers we are about to offer. We need to list existing ollama sentence transformers the user might have installed.
As for our python offerings, I want to offer few, but I donâ€™t want to download all of them, just cache them as they first download.
- Validation error on the FMDM when a chosen model was deleted (llama only our models can be re-downloaded).

- I want to discuss multiple systems for embeddings support, Ollama/folder-mcp python/transformers.js

***Daemon bugs:***
1. removing a folder should delete the .folder-mcp we added to the tracked folder.
