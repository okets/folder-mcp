***CONVERT PLAN TO SPRINTS***
Create the plan in a PAHSE_NUM_STEP_NUM.md under /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/docs/development-plan/roadmap/currently-implementing
- the plan should have small sprints with measurable progress and user safety stops after TUI changes.
- each change should be led by a user story and with clear user interface impact.
- sub tasks should be prioritized and groupped to acomodate to the previous requirement.
- backend changes must be verified using the agent led TMAOT method.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
***REVIEW PLAN***
1. Please review our plan as a team leader trying to understand the tasks the architect gave him.
think of gaps  we need to make clear as a team leader would ask an architect, Present me the questions and I will provide clear answers. 

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
***1. Implement with SCRUM***
For this task, I want to try implementing with SCRUM. I never tried scrum and would like to be guided through the method as we proceed.
I need you to act as a scrum master tasked with this prd:
'/Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/docs/development-plan/roadmap/currently-implementing/Phase-9-MCP-Endpoints-Multi-Folder-Support.md'
explain your thought process and your prioritization. if you use SCRUM terms give a short explaination of what the term is the first time you use it.
**2. TMOAT IT UP!**
I love this approach.
let me tell you my requirements for verifications for each user story.
1. for user stories that starts with "As an LLM", they should be verified by a custom subagent that we create that can run our MCP server.
this is the specification of creating a custom agent: 
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
using a subagent to test the mcp endpoints will speed development significantly. creating this subagent and adding our mcp endpoints to claude code should be a task in this phase.
2. backend changes must be verified using the TMOAT method.
  ***BE A GOOD TMOAT AGENT***
This task to be tested hands-on.
You need to think like a human engineer. break this into verifiable tests to validate your assumptions
rather than blindly changing a bunch of files and hoping you magically fixed all issues at the first shot. IT NEVER WORKS!
While you don't have access to the TUI because you cannot run interactive terminals. the TUI is just a presentation layer, our issues can be verified through other means.
we can query database files, see runtime files get changed or added, we can use TMOAT scripts to connect to websocket endpoints and listen for events or trigger actions.
We can place logs in the Daemon's logs. it need to run in a background service but we always can spawn a new one using `npm run daemon:restart`. this will kill any other instance of the daemon and will run a fresh one.
We can design end to end flows and see exactly where they fail. we have full visibility.
I would actually like this task to be tested hands-on.

3. TUI changes cannot be tested by an agent since you cannot run interactive terminals. these are the only tests that must be verified by a human in the loop.

We need to understand where in the folder lifecycle process the problems resides.
We fix issues in the order they appear in the folder lifecycle, fixing "downloading model" issues before "indexing" issues for example.
We need to work systematically towards a well defined, measurable goal that can be performed end-to-end by an AI agent.
You will need a TMOAT Script to add and remove folders consistently and clean up between test iterations. see if you can utilize the existing TMOAT script that already does this.


*** TMOAT Reminder ***
I remind you that we don't go and blindly change code hoping we fixed an issue. you as an agent can run bash commands and access the daemon's websocket using scripts. we are on a correct course task and should be very careful!
Be a good TMOAT agent!

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lets start working on '/Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/docs/development-plan/roadmap/currently-implementing/Phase-9-Implementation-epic.md' 
We are working one task at a time, start sprint 1, task 1.
I just want to make it clear we're not eliminating the CLI parameter -d, We are removing the need to specify folders in the mcp connection string only.
let me know when the test passes.


I want you to help me create an epic document from the PRD "/Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/docs/development-plan/roadmap/currently-implementing/Phase-9-PRD-MCP-Endpoints-Multi-Folder-Support.md"
**Epic Creation Guidelines:**
File name: Phase-9-Implementation-epic.md
The plan should be linear, straightforward, and builds functionality incrementally. Each sprint delivers working, testable functionality without complex dependencies.
I will lay out the the steps we need to take in order to transition from the single-folder, old mcp endpoints to the new, multi-folder multi-model architecture.
Background: 
- our current MCP endpoints runs off /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/src/mcp-server.ts
- this predates our Daemon and also doesn't work anymore as we changed the architecture.
- MCP endpoints connected through REST API or Json RPC

** Epic Sprints Roadmap **
I plan to transition our endpoints one by one under the Deamon's control. create an Agent led, revolutionary debugging method and work gradually towards transitioning ALL current endpoints to our new Multi-folder, Multi-model architecture.
1. Create REST server under the control of the Daemon.
The Daemon controls when it starts and also makes all internal Daemon functionallity available for the endpoints so we build upon existing functionality instead of building bridges.
2. Have the Daemon manage the lifecycle of the endpoints, including starting and stopping them as needed. exposing the REST API and JSON RPC functionality.
3. Migrate the simplest endpoint out of the old interface into the new interface. refactor the code to use the new multi-folder structure.
4. At this point, once the daemon is running we have an MCP server with one endpoint migrated to the new architecture. now it's time for the revolutionary Agent led method to take over.
after moving the mcp endpoint to the daemon, removing the mandatory folder param and supporting multi-folder for a simple endpoint, I would like to add a sprint for creating Claude-code agent led testing:
- Add our project as an mcp server to claude code.
- Create a specialized testing agent that only uses the MCP, no other tools. it should be tasked with testing the endpoints directly and be our mcp client for the TMOAT tests.
being able to instantly figure out how our change is reflected all the way to the MCP clients will revolutionize how we develop.
- the following tasks should be centered around this ability, every change to the endpoints will be validated using that subagent
5. Migrate the rest of the endpoints, one by one, each in it's own sprint. tested by the new subagent that can actually see the changes.

The goal is to have all endpoints migrated to the new architecture as described in the PRD and fully tested by the agent.
If the PRD has contradicting instructions, these instructions take precedence. tell me if you find any discrepancies.


-----------------------------agent-to-endpoint
agent-to-endpoint testing using project's directory indexing:
You are ignoring the fact that the folder mcp project is indexed in the folder mcp. So basically every md file that you have access to also is indexed, our tests/fixtures folder also contains many documents. read them directly and through the endpoints. this will be much faste

search memory mcp on how we do agent-to-endpoint testing. it doesn't involve creating scripts. its direct polling by using the mcp server we are building as a tool.
agent-to-endpoint is not TMOAT, both serve similar purposes but when testing endpoints, a2e is superior. I want you to add an agent-to-endpoint testing instructions. Think like a human. A human would have looked at the project which is indexed by the folder-mcp system, Would have asked a question that it already knows the answer for. Then compare the result with the answer it expected to get.You can read files, specific files within our project's document and use the endpoint to see if you get real information. You have access for both the project and its files and the endpoints that query the same files.

----------------------------end-to-end TMOAT+agent-to-endpoint
Let me tell you how to run this test end-to-end using a mix of TMOAT and agent-to-endpoint techniques.
If anything fails during this process we fix the root cause and we start the entire sequence over again.
TMOAT part:
1. run the daemon in a background service using 'npm run daemon:restart' no need to kill previous instances, the daemon:restart will handle this for you. monitor the logs when you need to figure out what the daemon is doing.
2. connect to the websocket interface, Remove  /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp from indexing list. if we are testing multiple folders, remove /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp-copy too. (The ./TMOAT folder contains a lot of scripts that does this exactly, see how they connect and copy the behavior)
3. Monitor the FMDM and query the database embeddings directly. see if the indexing went as expected. (Again, look at the ./TMOAT folder for examples)
4. Then re-add the folders using the model you want to test (Python or ONNX or one of each). monitor the indexing process closely.
A2E part:
now that the indexing works, you can start testing the endpoints directly. Use the MCP server to query the indexed documents and verify the responses.
If you need a Human to reconnect the MCP. (we are working on it live, it might be disconnected when we kill the daemon during development)

This is a foolproof way to test everything about our system.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
---------------------Next Task
When running the mcp server, if the daemon is not found, I thought maybe we can bring it up online instead of failing the request. can we do that or is there a an architectural difficulty?


──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--------------------- Code Rabbit
My automated code review suggested the following changes. I trust your judgment better so treat the recommendations with critical thinking!

1. /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/src/infrastructure/embeddings/onnx/onnx-embedding-service.ts
API change: generateEmbeddings now accepts chunks instead of strings
The method signature change from strings to chunks is a breaking change. The implementation correctly handles both string and chunk inputs, but all callers need to be updated.
# Search for calls to generateEmbeddings to ensure they're updated for the new signature (you can use tree sitter mcp for this)

2. /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/src/infrastructure/embeddings/onnx/onnx-embedding-service.ts
Missing prefixing logic for E5 models
The E5 models require specific prefixes for queries ("query: ") and passages ("passage: ") according to their documentation. The prefixing logic was removed but not replaced with the new text type handling.
Apply this diff to add the required prefixes based on text type:
-    const truncatedTexts = texts.map(text => 
-      text.length > maxLength ? text.substring(0, maxLength) : text
-    );
+    // Apply prefixes if the model requires them
+    let processedTexts = texts;
+    if (this.modelConfig?.requirements?.prefixes) {
+      const prefix = textType === 'query' 
+        ? this.modelConfig.requirements.prefixes.query || ''

3. /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/src/domain/models/model-evaluator.ts
CodeRabbit
lines 23-26:
    prefixes?: {
      query?: string;
      passage?: string;
    };
Breaking change: prefixes type changed from boolean to object
The change from boolean to { query?: string; passage?: string; } is a breaking change in the public interface. Ensure all consumers of CuratedModel are updated to handle the new structure.
#Comment from human: Didn't we roll it back?

4. /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/src/application/indexing/folder-lifecycle-service.ts
Consider adding a reprocessing limit to prevent infinite loops
While forcing reprocessing when embeddings are missing is good, there should be a mechanism to prevent infinite reprocessing loops if embedding generation consistently fails.
Consider tracking reprocessing attempts and failing after a reasonable number of retries:
-      // Override decision if we're forcing reprocessing due to missing embeddings
-      if (forceReprocess && !decision.shouldProcess) {
-        decision.shouldProcess = true;
-        decision.action = 'process';
-        decision.reason = 'No embeddings in database - forcing reprocess';
-      }
+      // Override decision if we're forcing reprocessing due to missing embeddings
+      if (forceReprocess && !decision.shouldProcess) {
+        // Check if file has been attempted too many times
+        const attemptCount = await this.fileStateService.getProcessingAttemptCount?.(filePath) || 0;
+        if (attemptCount < 3) {  // Allow up to 3 reprocessing attempts
+          decision.shouldProcess = true;
+          decision.action = 'process';
+          decision.reason = `No embeddings in database - forcing reprocess (attempt ${attemptCount + 1}/3)`;
+        } else {
+          this.logger.warn(`[MANAGER-DETECT] Skipping ${filePath} after 3 failed reprocessing attempts`);
+        }
+      }


5. /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/src/application/indexing/orchestrator.ts
const [provider, modelName] = modelId.includes(':') 
      ? modelId.split(':') 
      : ['gpu', modelId]; // Default to GPU for backward compatibility

Contradicts user instructions: "we don't fall back to GPU anymore. we do not keep backwards compatibility as we are in pre-production."

6. /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/src/infrastructure/embeddings/python-embedding-service.ts
Type the new convenience method.

Return EmbeddingVector instead of any and ensure a typed fallback.

-  async generateQueryEmbedding(query: string): Promise<any> {
+  async generateQueryEmbedding(query: string): Promise<EmbeddingVector> {
@@
-    return embeddings[0] || {
-      vector: [],
-      dimensions: 0
-    };
+    return embeddings[0] ?? {
+      vector: [],
+      dimensions: 0,
+      model: this.config.modelName,
+      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
+      chunkId: 'query_0'
+    };

7. /Users/hanan/Projects/folder-mcp/src/infrastructure/embeddings/onnx/onnx-embedding-service.ts
Cosine similarity implementation needs normalization check
The cosine similarity calculation assumes the vectors are already normalized. If they aren't, the result may not be in the [-1, 1] range.

Consider adding a normalization check or documenting the assumption:

  calculateSimilarity(vector1: any, vector2: any): number {
    // Cosine similarity calculation
    const v1 = Array.isArray(vector1) ? vector1 : vector1.vector;
    const v2 = Array.isArray(vector2) ? vector2 : vector2.vector;
    
    if (!v1 || !v2 || v1.length !== v2.length) {
      throw new Error('Vectors must have the same dimensions for similarity calculation');
    }
    
    let dotProduct = 0;
    let norm1 = 0;
    let norm2 = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < v1.length; i++) {
      dotProduct += v1[i] * v2[i];
      norm1 += v1[i] * v1[i];
      norm2 += v2[i] * v2[i];
    }

    const denominator = Math.sqrt(norm1) * Math.sqrt(norm2);
-    return denominator === 0 ? 0 : dotProduct / denominator;
+    const similarity = denominator === 0 ? 0 : dotProduct / denominator;
+    // Clamp to [-1, 1] range to handle floating point errors
+    return Math.max(-1, Math.min(1, similarity));
  }
