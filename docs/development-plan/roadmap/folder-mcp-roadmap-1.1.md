## Configuration Architecture

**Core Philosophy**: Configuration drives flexibility throughout the system. Every aspect of folder-mcp is configurable, with smart defaults that work out-of-the-box while enabling deep customization for power users.

### Configuration System (After Phase 7)

1. **Defaults**: `config-defaults.yaml` with sensible defaults
2. **User Config**: `~/.folder-mcp/config.yaml` for user overrides
3. **CLI Arguments**: Command-line flags for temporary overrides

**Schema-Driven**: Configuration structure defined by schemas that drive both validation and UI generation

### Configuration Principles

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple users see simple options, advanced users can access everything
- **Strategy Pattern**: All major components pluggable via configuration
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable features without code changes
- **Performance Tuning**: Every performance parameter exposed in config
- **Zero Config**: Works perfectly with no configuration file
- **Config Validation**: Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
- **Live Reload**: Changes apply without restart where possible
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible defaults that maximize functionality
- **Simple Transport**: Following Crawl4AI, only stdio and SSE transports supported

### Core Configuration Structure

The configuration system uses a flat YAML structure with these main sections:
- **general**: Basic settings (autoStart, logLevel, telemetry)
- **daemon**: Process management (port, pidFile, healthCheck, autoRestart)
- **embeddings**: Backend selection (ollama, direct, auto) with hardware optimization
- **search**: Core search and clustering configuration
- **transport**: Simple transports only (stdio for local, SSE for remote)
- **authentication**: API key-based authentication
- **folders**: Default settings and per-folder overrides
- **performance**: Resource limits and monitoring
- **ui**: Theme and display preferences for CLI/TUI
- **features**: Feature flags for new capabilities

Configuration follows simple override: config-defaults.yaml → config.yaml → CLI Arguments

**Note**: Phase 7 replaces the original 6-source hierarchical system with this simplified approach

### Configuration Usage Examples

```bash
# Override via CLI arguments
FOLDER_MCP_EMBEDDINGS_BACKEND=direct folder-mcp add ~/Documents

# Override via CLI flags
folder-mcp --config ~/.folder-mcp/prod.yaml add ~/Documents
folder-mcp --embeddings-backend ollama --log-level debug

# Query current configuration
folder-mcp config get embeddings.backend
folder-mcp config set search.clustering.enabled true
folder-mcp config validate

# Enable new features
folder-mcp config set features.topicDiscovery true

# Remote access setup
folder-mcp auth create "My Claude Desktop"  # Creates API key
folder-mcp tunnel setup                      # Interactive Cloudflare setup
```

## Component Definitions & Terminology

This section establishes the common terminology used throughout this document, with emphasis on configuration-driven components.

### Core Components

**Configuration Manager**  
The central component that loads, validates, merges, and provides configuration to all other components. It handles the simple two-file system (defaults and user config), validation via schemas, and live reloading. The Configuration Manager is the first component initialized and drives the behavior of all other components.

**Daemon**  
A configuration-aware background process that runs continuously and manages the lifecycle of a single multi-folder MCP server. The daemon's behavior is entirely driven by configuration, including auto-start behavior, health check intervals, and restart policies.

**MCP Server**  
A single process that serves multiple folders via the Model Context Protocol. The MCP server's capabilities, performance characteristics, and behavior are determined by configuration. It dynamically loads folder-specific configurations and adjusts its behavior accordingly. The server provides 13 endpoints for comprehensive document intelligence, including enhanced search with answer modes, topic discovery, context assembly, and relationship navigation.

**Express Server**  
A lightweight HTTP server built with Express.js (a minimal web framework for Node.js) that provides remote access to the MCP server via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Following Crawl4AI's proven pattern, it exposes three endpoints: `/health` for monitoring, `/` for basic info, and `/mcp/sse` for the MCP protocol. Uses simple Bearer token authentication. Express is chosen for its simplicity, widespread adoption, and excellent SSE support.

**Embedding System**  
The modular system responsible for generating vector embeddings from text. It supports multiple backends (Ollama, direct sentence-transformers, auto-selection) chosen via configuration. The system adapts to available hardware and memory constraints for optimal performance.

**Search System**  
A FAISS-based vector search system with pre-computed clustering for topic discovery. The search system provides both specific search capabilities and topic exploration through two distinct endpoints, with behavior driven by configuration.

**Transport System**  
Simple, proven transport mechanisms optimized for LLM consumption: stdio for local connections and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for remote access. Following Crawl4AI's pattern, the system deliberately avoids WebSockets and other complex abstractions in favor of battle-tested simplicity. Remote access uses Express.js with specific endpoints (/health, /mcp/sse) and Bearer token authentication. The transport choice is based on extensive analysis of how LLMs actually consume MCP services - prioritizing reliability, simplicity, and streaming capabilities over bidirectional communication that LLMs don't need.

**CLI (Command Line Interface)**  
The command-line tool that users invoke via `folder-mcp`. The CLI respects all configuration sources and provides flags to override any configuration option. It includes commands to inspect and modify configuration.

**TUI (Terminal User Interface)**  
The interactive, full-screen terminal interface built with existing Ink framework. The TUI's appearance, behavior, and capabilities are configuration-driven, including theme, animation settings, and update intervals.

**Admin Screen (Management Console)**  
The main TUI screen that displays all shared folders in a table format with their status, model, and port information. The layout and information displayed are configurable.

**Configuration Wizard**  
The initial TUI flow that guides users through creating their first configuration file. It uses progressive disclosure to show only relevant options based on user choices.

### Operational Terms

**Configuration Profile**  
A named set of configuration values that can be activated for different scenarios (development, production, resource-constrained, etc.).

**Configuration Override**  
A configuration value specified at runtime that takes precedence over file-based configuration.

**Feature Flag**  
A configuration setting that enables or disables specific functionality without code changes. Features can be toggled based on readiness, user preference, or system capabilities.

**Strategy Selection**  
Configuration-driven selection of implementation strategies (e.g., embedding backend, clustering algorithm, transport protocol).

**Embedding Backend**  
The implementation used to generate embeddings. Options include "ollama" (existing), "direct" (new sentence-transformers), or "auto" (automatic selection).

**Cluster ID**  
Pre-computed identifiers assigned during indexing that group similar content. Two types: semantic (by meaning) and folder (by location). These enable fast topic discovery without runtime clustering overhead.

## Project Goal

Create a configuration-driven daemon-based system that manages multiple MCP servers for shared folders, with TUI/CLI interfaces, intelligent model selection, and 13 LLM-optimized endpoints including enhanced search with answer modes, topic discovery, context assembly, code examples, relationship navigation, and comprehensive help - all designed for optimal LLM consumption patterns.

## UX-Led Development Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Every feature is designed from the user experience first, then implemented to support that experience, with configuration enabling different user preferences.

### **Development Approach**
1. **Configuration First**: Design configuration schema before implementation
2. **Best Defaults**: Choose defaults that enable maximum functionality
3. **CLI/TUI Parity**: Both interfaces expose same configuration options
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple config for simple needs, advanced for power users
5. **User Story Driven**: Each feature starts with user configuration needs
6. **Adaptive Planning**: Configuration schema evolves with learnings

### **Configuration-Driven UX**
- **Templates**: Example configurations for common use cases
- **Wizards**: Interactive configuration for complex settings
- **Validation**: Helpful error messages for configuration issues
- **Defaults**: Smart defaults that work without configuration
- **Validation**: Schema-based validation for all settings

## Phase 9: Perfect Indexing & Semantic Enhancement ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED (September 2025)

**Goal**: Perfect indexing, embeddings creation, semantic key phrases extraction, and multi-folder MCP endpoints support

**Why**: Phase 8 built multi-folder infrastructure. Phase 9 was intended to perfect the semantic quality AND connect MCP endpoints to the multi-folder system.

**What Completed**: Perfect semantic extraction pipeline with enhanced keyword quality, document-level aggregation, and multi-model optimization.

**What Was Cut Off**: MCP endpoints recreation to work with multi-folder system - moved to separate phase for focused implementation.

**Implementation Summary**:
Phase 9 achieved outstanding semantic quality improvements with research-validated techniques, but was strategically cut off after completing the indexing foundation to allow focused work on MCP endpoints separately.

**Key Achievements**:
- **✅ Enhanced Semantic Extraction**: KeyBERT and advanced clustering delivering >80% multiword phrases (vs previous 11% single words)
- **✅ Document-Level Aggregation**: Every document has pre-computed semantic metadata with 93%+ extraction confidence
- **✅ Model Excellence**: All 5 curated models (BGE-M3, E5-Large, MiniLM, E5-ONNX variants) optimized with model-specific configurations
- **✅ Quality Transformation**: >90% domain-specific topics (vs previous 29% generic), realistic readability scores (40-60 vs broken 3-11)
- **✅ Performance Optimization**: <2x processing time despite major quality improvements
- **✅ Database Storage**: Rich semantic metadata stored persistently for fast navigation access

**Deferred to Next Phase**:
- ❌ **MCP Endpoints Multi-Folder Integration**: Connecting endpoints to Phase 8's multi-folder infrastructure
- ❌ **Multi-Folder Search**: Cross-folder search and folder-aware operations
- ❌ **Folder-Aware Responses**: MCP responses that understand multi-folder context

**Strategic Decision**: Cut Phase 9 after indexing completion to create focused, manageable phases rather than one massive implementation.

## Phase 10: MCP Endpoints Multi-Folder Support

**Goal**: Connect MCP endpoints to Phase 8's multi-folder infrastructure to enable folder-aware operations

**Why**: Phase 8 built multi-folder indexing infrastructure and Phase 9 perfected semantic quality. Phase 10 completes the deferred work to make MCP endpoints folder-aware.

**What**: Transform existing MCP endpoints to work with multiple folders while maintaining the same excellent interface for LLMs.

**Key Implementation Areas**:
- **Multi-Folder Search**: Cross-folder search with folder-specific model routing
- **Folder-Aware Responses**: MCP responses that understand and communicate folder context
- **Dynamic Model Switching**: Automatic model selection based on folder configuration
- **Folder Discovery**: Enhanced list_folders to show all configured folders with their models and status
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain existing endpoint interfaces while adding folder awareness

**Success Criteria**: LLMs can discover, search, and retrieve documents across multiple folders with automatic model switching and folder context awareness.

## Phase 11: Semantic Endpoint Navigation

**Goal**: Transform folder-mcp from basic file server into intelligent knowledge navigator that LLMs can explore semantically

**Why**: Phase 9 built perfect semantic foundation and Phase 10 enabled multi-folder operations. Phase 11 leverages this foundation to create LLM-native navigation where every endpoint returns rich semantic metadata.

**What**:
- **Semantic Navigation Endpoints**: Enhance list_folders, list_documents, search, get_document_outline, and explore endpoints with semantic intelligence
- **Folder-Level Aggregation**: Build semantic previews by aggregating Phase 9's document semantic summaries
- **Enhanced Search**: Implement E5 optimization, filename-aware search, and hybrid keyword boosting
- **Hierarchical Exploration**: Create breadcrumb navigation with semantic hints from document metadata
- **Performance Optimization**: All endpoints <200ms using pre-computed semantic data from Phase 9

**Success Criteria**: LLMs can navigate intelligently using semantic metadata, with 75% reduction in exploratory reads and 95% accuracy in finding relevant content.

---

*This plan begins at Phase 10, as Phases 1-9 represent the substantial work already completed. Phase 9 was partially completed with outstanding semantic enhancement work (indexing, embeddings, and document-level aggregation) but was strategically cut off before MCP endpoints multi-folder integration to create more focused phases. This plan follows configuration-driven development principles where every feature is designed to be configurable from the start. The configuration system is not an afterthought but the core architectural principle that enables flexibility, customization, and future extensibility. The upcoming phases build systematically: Phase 10 (MCP multi-folder support) → Phase 11 (semantic navigation) → Phase 12+ (advanced features). Smart defaults ensure the system works excellently out-of-the-box while providing deep customization for power users. The plan is designed to evolve - after each phase completion, we review learnings and update future phases to ensure this document remains our single source of truth throughout the project.*
