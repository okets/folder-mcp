## � **VSCode MCP Optimization** (NEW TOP PRIORITY)
**Priority**: 🥇 **CRITICAL** - Main Goal: Efficient VSCode Integration

**BACKGROUND**: VSCode 1.101 adds extensive MCP support with tool sets, prompts, resources, dev mode, and advanced agent integration. This is now the primary development focus.

**IMMEDIATE TASKS** - See `VSCODE_MCP_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`:
- [ ] **V1**: Implement MCP Development Mode for instant testing (fastest ROI)
- [ ] **V2**: Create smart tool set organization (search, document, analysis, navigation, system)
- [ ] **V3**: Design MCP prompts for common workflows (/mcp.folder-mcp.analyze-folder)
- [ ] **V4**: Implement resource-based responses (save/drag to editor functionality)
- [ ] **V5**: Add VSCode-specific context awareness and agent mode optimization
- [ ] **V6**: Create custom chat modes for document analysis workflows

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- ✅ Hot reload < 2 seconds for development cycle
- ✅ Tool sets logically organized with icons
- ✅ Common tasks accessible via prompt shortcuts  
- ✅ Search results can be saved/dragged to VSCode editor
- ✅ Seamless integration with VSCode agent mode

## �🔧 **Enhanced Logging & Monitoring** (Foundation Complete ✅)
**Priority**: � Medium (Foundation ready, enhanced features ready to implement)

**INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETED** ✅ - See `LOGGING_INFRASTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`
- [x] **Foundation**: Production-ready logging infrastructure with MCP compliance
- [x] **CLI**: Complete log management commands (`folder-mcp log --help`)
- [x] **Testing**: Full test coverage and validation
- [x] **Integration**: DI bridge and runtime configuration

**READY FOR ENHANCED FEATURES**:
- [x] **E3**: Add MCP request/response logging with payloads (easy - infrastructure ready)
- [x] **E4**: Add search query logging with results count (easy - infrastructure ready)  
- [x] **E5**: Add performance timing logs for indexing operations (easy - infrastructure ready)
- [x] **E6**: Implement log level configuration for debugging (✅ DONE - CLI commands available)

## 🌐 **MCP Protocol Polish**

**Priority**: 🥈 Medium (Professional touch for client integrations)

- [ ] **G1**: Fix any identified MCP protocol compliance issues
- [ ] **G2**: Improve error messages in MCP responses
- [ ] **G3**: Add request validation to MCP endpoints
- [ ] **G4**: Implement proper timeout handling for MCP operations
- [ ] **G5**: Add MCP protocol version compatibility checks
- [ ] **G6**: Implement graceful degradation for unsupported operations

## 🧪 **Advanced Testing Suite**

**Priority**: 🥉 Low (Nice for CI/CD, but manual testing works)

- [ ] **I1**: Create automated file watcher test suite
- [ ] **I2**: Create MCP protocol compliance test suite
- [ ] **I3**: Create search functionality test suite
- [ ] **I4**: Create end-to-end integration test
- [ ] **I5**: Test with various file types and sizes
- [ ] **I6**: Test with concurrent file modifications
- [ ] **I7**: Stress test with large number of files
- [ ] **I8**: Test error recovery scenarios

## 📈 **Smart Document Features** (From Claude Desktop Feedback)

**Priority**: 🥉 Low (Advanced features for specific use cases)

- [ ] **ENH-1**: Add version-specific metadata fields for software documentation
- [ ] **ENH-2**: Implement document freshness scoring for search ranking
- [ ] **ENH-3**: Create software-specific search templates and categorization
- [ ] **ENH-4**: Add automated version detection in software documentation
- [ ] **ENH-5**: Implement change log tracking and version history

---

## 🚀 **Advanced Capabilities**

**Priority**: 🥉 Low (Future expansion features)

- [ ] **IMP-1**: Add comprehensive document validation during ingestion
- [ ] **IMP-2**: Create automated categorization system (software vs. general docs)
- [ ] **IMP-3**: Implement better integration between document and web search

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### Recommended Work Order:
1. **Start with Enhanced Logging** (E3-E6) - Foundation for debugging future work
2. **Add File Watcher Robustness** (F3-F5) - System reliability improvements  
3. **Polish MCP Protocol** (G1-G6) - Client experience enhancements
4. **Expand Testing** (I1-I8) - Quality assurance automation
5. **Smart Features** (ENH1-ENH5) - Advanced functionality
6. **Future Capabilities** (IMP1-IMP3) - Long-term expansion

### Context:
- Core system is **fully functional** ✅
- These tasks **improve quality and capabilities**
- Pick tasks based on **current priorities and time available**
- Each category can be tackled **independently**
