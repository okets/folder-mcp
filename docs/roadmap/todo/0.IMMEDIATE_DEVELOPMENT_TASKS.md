# Immediate Development Tasks
---
## **File Watcher Issues**
- [ ] **F1**: Support file deletion events, remove embeddings for the deleted files
- [ ] **F2**: Add support for file renaming events, update embeddings and metadata accordingly
- [ ] **F3**: Improve file watcher robustness against multiple file changes in quick succession (like rapid pasting files from another folder or group deletion)
- [ ] **F4**: Update test suite to cover F1-F3

## üîß **Enhanced Logging & Monitoring** (Quick Wins)
**Priority**: ü•á High (Easy implementation, great debugging value)

- [ ] **E3**: Add MCP request/response logging with payloads
- [ ] **E4**: Add search query logging with results count  
- [ ] **E5**: Add performance timing logs for indexing operations
- [ ] **E6**: Implement log level configuration for debugging

## üåê **MCP Protocol Polish**

**Priority**: ü•à Medium (Professional touch for client integrations)

- [ ] **G1**: Fix any identified MCP protocol compliance issues
- [ ] **G2**: Improve error messages in MCP responses
- [ ] **G3**: Add request validation to MCP endpoints
- [ ] **G4**: Implement proper timeout handling for MCP operations
- [ ] **G5**: Add MCP protocol version compatibility checks
- [ ] **G6**: Implement graceful degradation for unsupported operations

## üß™ **Advanced Testing Suite**

**Priority**: ü•â Low (Nice for CI/CD, but manual testing works)

- [ ] **I1**: Create automated file watcher test suite
- [ ] **I2**: Create MCP protocol compliance test suite
- [ ] **I3**: Create search functionality test suite
- [ ] **I4**: Create end-to-end integration test
- [ ] **I5**: Test with various file types and sizes
- [ ] **I6**: Test with concurrent file modifications
- [ ] **I7**: Stress test with large number of files
- [ ] **I8**: Test error recovery scenarios

## üìà **Smart Document Features** (From Claude Desktop Feedback)

**Priority**: ü•â Low (Advanced features for specific use cases)

- [ ] **ENH-1**: Add version-specific metadata fields for software documentation
- [ ] **ENH-2**: Implement document freshness scoring for search ranking
- [ ] **ENH-3**: Create software-specific search templates and categorization
- [ ] **ENH-4**: Add automated version detection in software documentation
- [ ] **ENH-5**: Implement change log tracking and version history

---

## üöÄ **Advanced Capabilities**

**Priority**: ü•â Low (Future expansion features)

- [ ] **IMP-1**: Add comprehensive document validation during ingestion
- [ ] **IMP-2**: Create automated categorization system (software vs. general docs)
- [ ] **IMP-3**: Implement better integration between document and web search

## üìù **Implementation Notes**

### Recommended Work Order:
1. **Start with Enhanced Logging** (E3-E6) - Foundation for debugging future work
2. **Add File Watcher Robustness** (F3-F5) - System reliability improvements  
3. **Polish MCP Protocol** (G1-G6) - Client experience enhancements
4. **Expand Testing** (I1-I8) - Quality assurance automation
5. **Smart Features** (ENH1-ENH5) - Advanced functionality
6. **Future Capabilities** (IMP1-IMP3) - Long-term expansion

### Context:
- Core system is **fully functional** ‚úÖ
- These tasks **improve quality and capabilities**
- Pick tasks based on **current priorities and time available**
- Each category can be tackled **independently**
