### 2. *** Make My MCP Functionality Perfect!
**Tasks Created after reading this:** https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101
- **Enhanced Search with MCP Prompts:** Create specialized prompts for common queries
- **Rich Resource Responses:**
  Return search results as resources that can be:
  - Saved directly from chat
  - Dragged to the editor
  - Include metadata for context
- **Smart Tool Organization**
  Group your tools logically: (below is just an example)
  - Search Tools: search, find similar, get context
  - Index Tools: refresh, status, configure
  - Analysis Tools: summarize folder, get statistics

- **Implement Dev Mode for MCP Server.**
  This can speed up the dev process since I can test it directly instead of Launching Claude Desktop every time.
### 3. Support Legacy Doc, Xls, Ppt Formats
