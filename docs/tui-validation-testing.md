# TUI Validation Testing Guide

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented validation features for TextInput components:

### ✅ Implemented Features:
1. **Validation Rules**:
   - `email()` - Email format validation
   - `ipAddress()` - IPv4/IPv6 validation  
   - `number()` - Number with min/max/integer constraints
   - `customRegex()` - Custom pattern validation

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Real-time validation as user types
   - Red error messages below input: `✗ Error message`
   - `[!]` indicator in collapsed state for invalid values
   - Blocks saving when validation fails

3. **Sample Configuration Updated**:
   - Added validation to existing fields (Memory Limit, Network Timeout, etc.)
   - Added new test fields (User Age, Website URL, Hex Color, Username, etc.)

## Integration Status

**Note**: The current `npm run tui` uses an older configuration system (`ConfigurationListItem`) that doesn't support the new validation features. The validation is implemented in the newer node-based configuration system (`TextInputNode`, `YesNoNode`).

To see validation in action, the main TUI would need to be updated to use the configuration nodes system instead of the legacy list items.

## What's Ready

The validation system is fully functional and tested:
- All validators pass unit tests
- TextInputNode component has full validation support
- Sample configuration includes diverse validation examples

## Next Steps

To test validation in the main TUI, one of these approaches is needed:
1. Update ConfigurationPanel to use the node-based system
2. Create a new panel that uses configuration nodes
3. Replace the legacy ConfigurationListItem system with the newer nodes

The validation infrastructure is complete and ready to use once the main TUI is updated to use the configuration nodes system.
