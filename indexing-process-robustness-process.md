# Production-Ready Indexing: Comprehensive Test & Fix Plan

**Goal**: Make our indexing system production-grade reliable, not just pass tests. This plan addresses all potential failure scenarios and edge cases that could break our indexing system in production.

## üö® Critical Production Scenarios We Must Handle

### 1. File System Volatility (Most Common in Production)
- [ ] **During Scanning**: Files added/removed/modified while scanning
- [ ] **During Indexing**: Files added/removed/modified while indexing  
- [ ] **Folder Deletion**: Entire monitored folder deleted while daemon running
- [ ] **Folder Rename**: Monitored folder renamed (appears as delete + create)
- [ ] **Network Drives**: Mounted drives that disconnect/reconnect
- [ ] **Symlinks**: Following/not following, broken symlinks, circular references

### 2. Permission & Access Failures
- [ ] **Read-Only Folder**: Can't create `.folder-mcp` directory
- [ ] **No Read Permission**: Folder exists but can't scan files
- [ ] **Mixed Permissions**: Some files readable, others not (partial indexing)
- [ ] **Permission Changes**: Permissions changed while monitoring
- [ ] **Disk Full**: Can't write embeddings database
- [ ] **File Locks**: Files locked by other processes during indexing

### 3. Daemon Lifecycle Resilience
- [ ] **Crash Recovery**: Daemon crashes mid-indexing, must resume correctly
- [ ] **Graceful Restart**: Save state, restart, continue where left off
- [ ] **Orphaned Processes**: Clean up zombie embedding processes
- [ ] **Multiple Instances**: Prevent duplicate daemons
- [ ] **State Persistence**: Remember folder states across restarts
- [ ] **Configuration Changes**: Handle config updates without data loss

### 4. Concurrent Operation Chaos
- [ ] **Rapid Add/Remove**: Same folder added/removed/added quickly
- [ ] **Duplicate Adds**: Same folder added twice simultaneously
- [ ] **Parallel Indexing**: 10+ folders indexing at once
- [ ] **State Race Conditions**: Multiple state transitions at once
- [ ] **WebSocket Floods**: Multiple clients sending conflicting commands

### 5. Resource Exhaustion
- [ ] **Memory**: Indexing 100,000+ files
- [ ] **CPU**: Throttling under load
- [ ] **File Descriptors**: Too many open files
- [ ] **Inotify Limits**: Linux file watcher limits
- [ ] **Disk I/O**: Slow disks causing timeouts
- [ ] **Network**: Embedding service timeouts

### 6. Database Integrity
- [ ] **Corruption**: Detect and rebuild corrupted databases
- [ ] **Incomplete Writes**: Handle power loss during write
- [ ] **Version Mismatch**: Migrate old database schemas
- [ ] **Lock Contention**: Multiple processes accessing same DB
- [ ] **Backup/Restore**: Ability to recover from backups

### 7. Error Recovery & Resilience
- [ ] **Transient Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Partial Success**: Some files indexed, others failed
- [ ] **Dead Letter Queue**: Track permanently failed files
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker**: Stop trying after N failures
- [ ] **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from known issues

## üìù Progress Notes

### Test Suite A Progress: File System Chaos

**Test 1 - Files changing during indexing: üî¥ MAJOR ISSUE FOUND**
- **Issue**: File watching appears to be working (daemon logs show file watcher started), but when files are added/modified/deleted in an active folder, the daemon does not detect the changes and transition back to scanning/indexing.
- **Evidence**: 
  - Created fresh folder with 20 files
  - Added folder to daemon ‚Üí went through scanning ‚Üí indexing ‚Üí active (100%)
  - Added 2 new files, deleted 2 files, modified 1 file after reaching active state
  - Created additional obvious test files (major_change.txt, another_test.txt, obvious_new_file.txt)
  - **Result**: Daemon stayed at "active (100%)" - no state transitions detected
- **Expected**: Should transition active ‚Üí scanning ‚Üí ready ‚Üí indexing ‚Üí active when changes detected
- **Root Cause**: File watcher is started but change detection is not triggering folder state transitions properly

**Test 2 - Folder deletion while active: üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**
- **Issue**: When a monitored folder is deleted from disk while daemon is running, the daemon does not detect this and keeps the folder in FMDM with "active" status
- **Evidence**:
  - Created folder with 5 files
  - Added to daemon ‚Üí scanning ‚Üí indexing ‚Üí active (100%)
  - Deleted entire folder from disk using `rm -rf`
  - **Result**: Folder remained in FMDM with "active (100%)" status
- **Expected**: Folder should be removed from FMDM or marked with error status
- **Root Cause**: No folder existence validation or file watcher error handling for deleted folders

**Critical Issues Summary:**
1. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - File changes in active folders are now properly detected and trigger re-scanning
2. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Deleted folders are automatically removed from FMDM via periodic validation

**Fixes Implemented:**
- **File Change Detection**: 
  - Added `setChangeDetectionCallback` in `MonitoringOrchestrator` 
  - Connected file watcher events to `MonitoredFoldersOrchestrator.onChangesDetected()`
  - Modified `FolderLifecycleService.startScanning()` to allow transitions from `active` ‚Üí `scanning`
  - File changes now properly trigger: active ‚Üí scanning ‚Üí ready ‚Üí indexing ‚Üí active

- **Folder Deletion Detection**:
  - Added periodic folder validation timer (every 30 seconds) in `MonitoredFoldersOrchestrator`
  - Validates all monitored folders still exist using `fs.existsSync()`
  - Automatically removes non-existent folders from FMDM and configuration
  - Cleans up file watchers and managers for deleted folders

**Additional Production Enhancements:**
- ‚úÖ **Daemon Restart Persistence**: Implemented proper `startAll()` method to restore folders from configuration
- ‚úÖ **Error Folder Reporting**: Enhanced FMDM to track and report error folders separately
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Persistence**: Added automatic saving/removal of folders to/from configuration

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ File added to active folder ‚Üí detected within ~2-5 seconds ‚Üí proper re-indexing
- ‚úÖ Folder deleted from disk ‚Üí removed from FMDM within ~30 seconds ‚Üí no ghost folders
- ‚úÖ All existing test suites passing (Python embeddings, performance, user stories, file watching)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2 daemon e2e tests still failing (WebSocket FMDM broadcast + error reporting issues)

### Latest Progress (2025-01-07):

#### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Daemon Restart Functionality
- **Issue**: Daemon restart test failing with "FMDM update timeout after 5000ms"
- **Root Cause**: DaemonRegistry singleton enforcement preventing new daemon from starting
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ Added explicit `updateDaemonStatus()` call to ensure FMDM has daemon info  
  - ‚úÖ Added `--restart` flag to override singleton enforcement
  - ‚úÖ Added 2-second delay after daemon termination to ensure ports are released
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced process management with proper SIGTERM handling
- **Evidence**: Restarted daemon shows proper startup sequence, WebSocket server starts, clients can connect
- **Status**: Daemon restart functionality is working correctly

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **OPEN ISSUES** - E2E Test Failures
1. **WebSocket Initial FMDM Broadcast Race Condition**:
   - Client connects to restarted daemon successfully
   - Initial FMDM state not sent to newly connected clients
   - Race condition or timing issue in WebSocket message handling

2. **Error Reporting Test Timeout**:
   - "should report errors through FMDM" test failing with 10s timeout
   - Error state not being properly broadcast to WebSocket clients
   - Same underlying WebSocket broadcast issue

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **OPEN ISSUE** - Folder Lifecycle State Problem  
- **Issue**: On daemon restart, TUI shows all folders as "indexing (0%)" instead of proper lifecycle
- **Expected Flow**: pending ‚Üí scanning ‚Üí ready ‚Üí indexing ‚Üí active
- **Current Flow**: indexing ‚Üí active (missing intermediate states)
- **Impact**: User experience shows incorrect progress states

**Production Readiness Status:**
üéØ **CORE PRODUCTION ISSUES RESOLVED** - The indexing system handles the two most critical production scenarios (file changes + folder deletion). **Daemon restart functionality is working correctly**. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING ISSUES**: WebSocket broadcast race condition affecting test reliability and user experience. This needs to be resolved for full production readiness.
