folder-mcp is a universal tool that transforms any local folder into an intelligent knowledge base that Large Language Models (LLMs) can query for context-aware responses.

The tool works by scanning a folder and parsing all document types including PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, and text files. It extracts meaningful content while preserving document structure and relationships.

Key capabilities include:
- Universal file support with intelligent parsing
- Structure preservation (slides, tables, sections)
- Smart chunking by meaning rather than arbitrary sizes
- Rich metadata tracking for precise retrieval
- Smart caching system with embeddings stored in .folder-mcp-cache
- Incremental updates that only process changed files

The tool creates semantic embeddings for intelligent retrieval and serves the content via MCP (Model Context Protocol) so any LLM can access your data, enabling RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for accurate, context-specific responses.

This makes it perfect for creating searchable knowledge bases from existing document collections, whether for personal use, team collaboration, or enterprise knowledge management.
