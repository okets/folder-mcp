# Test System Correction Analysis

## Overview
After the massive architectural changes from our course correction plan (Steps 1-8), we now have 30 failed tests across 8 files that need systematic analysis. This document provides a TMOAT-style analysis of each failing test to determine the best course of action.

## Test Categories and Status

### 1. Architectural Pattern Tests (`tests/architectural/patterns.test.ts`)
**Status**: 2 failures
**Pattern**: Dependency Injection Pattern compliance

#### Analysis: KEEP AND FIX 
**Failure**: `should use dependency injection for service dependencies`
**Root Cause**: Course correction introduced new services (FolderIndexingQueue, UnifiedModelFactory, IEmbeddingModel bridges) that may not follow proper DI patterns.
**Action Required**: Fix the implementation to properly register new services in DI container
**Business Value**: HIGH - Architectural integrity is critical for maintainability

---

### 2. Daemon E2E Integration Tests (`tests/integration/daemon-e2e.test.ts`)
**Status**: 10 failures
**Pattern**: All timeout-related failures

#### Analysis: KEEP BUT MAJOR REFACTOR NEEDED
**Failures**:
- `should complete full folder lifecycle via daemon` - Timeout
- `should detect and process multiple file types` - Timeout  
- `should handle concurrent folder processing` - Timeout (NOW INVALID)
- `should provide real-time progress updates` - Timeout
- `should handle daemon restart with persistent folder state` - Timeout
- `should handle folder removal during processing` - Timeout
- `should detect and handle files removed after indexing` - Timeout
- `should debounce multiple rapid file changes` - Timeout
- `should report errors through FMDM` - Timeout

**Root Cause**: Sequential processing architecture (Step 6) fundamentally changed how the daemon works:
- NO MORE CONCURRENT PROCESSING - folders index one at a time
- Different timing expectations due to model loading/switching
- FMDM state changes are different (queuing, sequential progression)

**Actions Required**:
1. **INVALID TEST**: `should handle concurrent folder processing` - DELETE (contradicts sequential architecture)
2. **UPDATE TIMEOUTS**: Increase timeouts for remaining tests (model loading takes time)
3. **UPDATE EXPECTATIONS**: Tests expecting concurrent behavior need sequential behavior assertions
4. **UPDATE STATE VALIDATION**: FMDM states now include "pending", "queued" statuses

**Business Value**: CRITICAL - These are our primary integration tests

---

### 3. Daemon Crash Recovery Tests (`tests/integration/daemon-crash-recovery.test.ts`)
**Status**: 2 failures
**Pattern**: Daemon startup failures

#### Analysis: KEEP AND FIX
**Failures**:
- `should preserve indexing work after daemon restart` - Daemon startup timeout
- `should handle corrupted database gracefully with restart recovery` - Daemon exited unexpectedly

**Root Cause**: Step 9 issue - daemon takes too long to start up, affecting crash recovery tests
**Action Required**: 
1. Fix daemon startup performance (investigate slow initialization)
2. Update test timeouts if startup optimization isn't possible
3. Ensure crash recovery works with sequential processing

**Business Value**: HIGH - Production stability depends on crash recovery

---

### 4. Daemon Registry Tests (`tests/daemon/registry/daemon-registry.test.ts`)
**Status**: 8 failures
**Pattern**: All fail due to existing daemon process (PID 5442)

#### Analysis: KEEP BUT FIX TEST ISOLATION
**Failures**: All registry tests fail because they can't register due to existing daemon

**Root Cause**: Test environment contamination - daemon from previous test run still running
**Action Required**:
1. Add proper test cleanup - kill any existing daemon processes before tests
2. Add beforeEach/afterEach hooks to ensure clean daemon state
3. Consider using different ports for test daemons vs real daemons

**Business Value**: HIGH - Daemon registry is critical for TUI<->daemon communication

---

### 5. SQLite Vector Integration Tests (`tests/daemon/indexing/sqlite-vec-integration.test.ts`)
**Status**: 1 failure
**Pattern**: Database file not created

#### Analysis: KEEP AND FIX
**Failure**: `should create per-folder databases in correct locations`
**Issue**: `expect(existsSync(dbPath)).toBe(true)` - embeddings.db not created

**Root Cause**: Sequential processing may have changed where/when SQLite databases are created
**Action Required**: Verify SQLite database creation in new architecture, fix path/timing issues

**Business Value**: CRITICAL - Vector storage is core functionality

---

### 6. Configuration Validation Tests (`tests/unit/config/ConfigurationComponent.test.ts`)
**Status**: 1 failure
**Pattern**: Model validation failure

#### Analysis: KEEP AND FIX
**Failure**: `should accept supported embedding models`
**Issue**: Model validation returning false for supported models

**Root Cause**: Step 8 model ID prefix changes (`folder-mcp:` → `gpu:`, `folder-mcp-lite:` → `cpu:`) broke model validation
**Action Required**: Update model validation logic to recognize new prefixes

**Business Value**: MEDIUM - Validation prevents user errors but not core functionality

---

### 7. ONNX Model Bridge Tests (`tests/integration/onnx-model-bridge.test.ts`)
**Status**: 1 failure
**Pattern**: Vector similarity calculation

#### Analysis: KEEP AND FIX
**Failure**: `should calculate similarity between vectors`

**Root Cause**: Step 5 ONNX bridge implementation may have introduced vector calculation issues
**Action Required**: Debug ONNX vector similarity calculation, ensure bridge implements interface correctly

**Business Value**: MEDIUM - ONNX models are alternative to Python models

---

### 8. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/indexing.perf.test.ts`)
**Status**: 8 failures  
**Pattern**: Environment setup issues

#### Analysis: CONDITIONAL - SKIP OR FIX ENVIRONMENT
**Failure**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'cleanup')`
**Issue**: Test environment not properly initialized (`env.cleanup()`)

**Root Cause**: Performance test environment setup broken, possibly due to architectural changes
**Action Required**: 
- **OPTION A**: Fix environment setup if performance tests are critical
- **OPTION B**: Skip/disable performance tests and rely on manual TMOAT verification

**Business Value**: LOW - Nice to have but not blocking core functionality

---

## CRITICAL FINDING: Model ID Mismatch Issue

**🚨 ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**: From live daemon logs during test execution:
```
Error: Model gpu:paraphrase-multilingual-minilm not found in curated models
```

**Analysis**: Step 8 model ID prefix changes (`folder-mcp:` → `gpu:`, `folder-mcp-lite:` → `cpu:`) are complete in the codebase, but:

1. **Tests are using invalid model IDs**: `gpu:paraphrase-multilingual-minilm` doesn't exist in curated models
2. **Curated models file**: Needs verification of actual available model IDs after Step 8 changes
3. **Test model selection**: Tests need to use valid model IDs that actually exist

**Impact**: This single issue is causing cascading failures across ALL daemon E2E tests because folders can't be added due to invalid model IDs.

**Investigation Results**: 
✅ `gpu:paraphrase-multilingual-minilm` IS in curated-models.json (line 214)  
❌ BUT the daemon can't find it: `Model gpu:paraphrase-multilingual-minilm not found in curated models`

**Root Cause**: Model loading/lookup mechanism is broken. Possibilities:
1. Model registry/loader not reading curated-models.json correctly
2. Model lookup logic has bugs introduced during Step 8 refactoring  
3. File path issues or JSON parsing problems

**Immediate Fix Required**: 
1. Debug model lookup mechanism in daemon/orchestrator
2. Fix model loading to properly read curated-models.json
3. This will likely fix 80% of the failing tests immediately

**Available Model IDs for Tests**:
- GPU Models: `gpu:bge-m3`, `gpu:multilingual-e5-large`, `gpu:paraphrase-multilingual-minilm`
- CPU Models: `cpu:xenova-multilingual-e5-small`, `cpu:xenova-multilingual-e5-large`

## Test Strategy Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Unblock Development)

1. **Kill existing daemon processes**: `pkill -f "folder-mcp.*daemon"`
2. **Skip performance tests temporarily**: Add `.skip()` to performance tests
3. **Fix DI registration**: Register new services properly in container
4. **Update model validation**: Support new model ID prefixes

### Medium-term Fixes (1-2 days)

1. **Refactor daemon E2E tests**: Update for sequential processing, remove concurrent test
2. **Fix daemon startup**: Investigate Step 9 slow startup issue
3. **Fix SQLite integration**: Ensure databases created with new architecture
4. **Fix test isolation**: Add proper setup/teardown for daemon tests

### Strategic Questions

1. **Performance Tests**: Keep or remove? Manual TMOAT testing might be sufficient
2. **Test Timeouts**: How much longer should tests wait given sequential processing?
3. **ONNX Bridge**: Is this critical for Phase 8 or can we focus on Python models?

## Suggested New Tests (Based on Course Correction Steps)

Given the architectural changes, we need NEW tests to cover our new capabilities:

### 1. Sequential Processing Tests
```typescript
// Test that only one folder indexes at a time
describe('Sequential Folder Processing', () => {
  it('should process folders one at a time');
  it('should show pending status for queued folders');
  it('should handle queue when folders added/removed');
});
```

### 2. Model Bridge Tests  
```typescript
// Test unified model interface
describe('Model Bridge Integration', () => {
  it('should switch between Python and ONNX models');
  it('should pause/resume indexing for semantic search');
  it('should handle model loading failures gracefully');
});
```

### 3. Priority Queue Tests
```typescript
// Test semantic search interruption
describe('Priority Processing', () => {
  it('should interrupt indexing for immediate search requests');
  it('should resume indexing after priority request completes');
  it('should handle model switching during priority requests');
});
```

### 4. FMDM State Tests
```typescript
// Test new folder states from sequential processing
describe('FMDM State Management', () => {
  it('should show correct queue positions');
  it('should update states during sequential processing');
  it('should handle folder removal from queue');
});
```

## Success Metrics

To know when our test system is healthy:

1. **Zero test environment contamination**: All tests run clean from fresh state
2. **Accurate business logic coverage**: Tests verify sequential processing correctly  
3. **Proper timeout values**: Tests don't fail due to new architectural timing
4. **New architecture coverage**: Tests verify unified model interface and priority queues
5. **TMOAT complementarity**: Automated tests cover unit logic, TMOAT covers end-to-end flows

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
- Kill daemon processes and fix test isolation
- Skip performance tests temporarily  
- Fix DI pattern compliance
- Update model validation for new prefixes

**Phase 2 (This week)**:
- Refactor daemon E2E tests for sequential processing
- Fix SQLite database creation
- Add new sequential processing tests
- Fix daemon startup performance

**Phase 3 (Next week)**:  
- Decide on performance tests (fix or remove)
- Add comprehensive FMDM state tests
- Add priority queue interruption tests
- Polish ONNX bridge if needed

This systematic approach will restore test system health while ensuring our new sequential processing architecture is properly validated.
